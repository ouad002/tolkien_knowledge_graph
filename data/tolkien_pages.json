In his aged face under great snowy brows his eyes were set like coals that could suddenly burst into fire.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[Many Meetings]]\"}}\n\n'''Gandalf''' was one of the five [[Order of Wizards|Istari]] sent to [[Middle-earth]] by the [[Valar]] in the [[Third Age]]. In [[Valinor]] he was known as Olórin. Gandalf was instrumental in bringing about the demise of [[Sauron]] in {{TA|3019}}, chiefly by encouraging others and dispensing his wisdom at pivotal times. He was originally robed in grey, and second to [[Saruman]] in the Order of Wizards. After his fall in [[Moria]], Gandalf returned to Middle-earth as head of the Order, robed in white. He was noteworthy for his keen interest in [[Hobbits]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Kip Rasmussen - Olorin in the Gardens of Lorien.jpg|thumb|left|''Olorin in the Gardens of Lorien'' by [[:Category:Images by Kip Rasmussen|Kip Rasmussen]]]]\nThe wisest of the [[Maiar]], Gandalf was created by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=\"Ainu\">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> At the beginning of [[Time]], he was amongst the [[Ainur]] who entered into [[Eä]].<ref name=\"SVala\">{{S|Vala}}</ref> In his \"youth\" he was known as '''''Olórin''''' and lived in [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]. Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience.<ref name=\"vala\">{{S|IIc}}, p. 316</ref> He became one of the [[Maiar]] who served [[Manwë]], [[Varda]], [[Irmo]], and [[Nienna]]. He was associated with light and fire, much like [[Varda]].\n\nAfter the Valar discovered the primeval [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]], Olórin was sent there as one of the [[Five Guardians]] to guard the Elves from the forces of [[Melkor]].<ref>{{NM|P1xiii}}, p. 95</ref> It is unclear how long he remained or if he accompanied the [[Eldar]] on the [[Great Journey]]. But it is said he loved the Elves, and throughout his early life, he walked [[Unseen]] among them, or wore a [[Fana]] that appeared like an Elf, and he sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, taking pity on the sorrows of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] and lifting out of despair those who listened to him.<ref name=\"vala\" />\n\nIt is possible that Gandalf, as Olorin, came to Middle-earth in the Second Age. While Galadriel \"dwelt now under the trees of Greenwood the Great\" Olórin once had a conversation with her.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 255</ref> It is possible that this was just after the year 1200, but it is said that \"only those Wise could say who are now gone\" could attest to the truth of this conversation.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 268</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\n====Arrival in Middle-earth====\nDuring the [[Third Age]], while [[Sauron|Sauron's]] 'dark spirit of malice' was increasing over [[Middle-earth]], the Valar chose the [[Istari]], missionaries from among the Maiar, to go to Middle-earth and help the [[Portal:Characters|peoples]]. [[Manwë]] selected Olórin, who, at first, did not wish to go, as he feared Sauron. However, Manwë said that it was all the more reason why he should go.<ref name=\"Istari\">{{UT|13}}</ref> Furthermore, [[the One Ring]], the location of much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere in Middle-earth. \n\nOlórin submitted to the will of Manwë and departed Valinor to [[Mithlond]] in the year {{TA|1000}}.<ref name=\"Istari\" /> He arrived shortly after two other Istari, [[Curumo]] and [[Aiwendil]], at about the same time the [[Necromancer]] appeared in [[Mirkwood]]. Like the other Wizards, he took the shape of an old man. He was robed in grey. \n\nAt Mithlond, he was welcomed by [[Círdan]] the shipwright, who possessed [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings|Three]] Elven [[Rings of Power]]. Círdan divined in Olórin a sense of strength and power despite his appearance as a bent and aged old man. Círdan gave Narya to Olórin with a prediction of his future struggles with evil, and a promise that it would support and aid him in his labours. Then Círdan said \"''But as for me, my heart is with the [[Belegaer|Sea]], and I will dwell by the grey shores until the last ship sails. I will await you.''\"<ref name=\"ThirdAge\">{{App|B2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Howe - Gandalf the Grey.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nGandalf then began his sojourn in Middle-earth, going about as a wanderer and counsellor. Unlike Saruman, Gandalf did not take up a single permanent residence. Gandalf never went to the [[east]]<ref name=\"TT Window p. 670\">{{TT|Window}}, p. 670</ref> and apparently restricted his activities to the [[Westlands]] of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the [[Dúnedain]] and the [[Eldar]] remained to oppose Sauron. He was known by many names during the long years he remained in Middle-earth: Elves named him ''Mithrandir'', the Grey Pilgrim, while the men of [[Arnor]] named him '''Gandalf''', which became his most common name. He was also known as ''Incánus'' in the south, and ''Tharkûn'' to the [[Dwarves]].<ref name=\"Istari\" />\n\nA legend says that Gandalf was given the [[Elfstone]] of [[Eärendil]] by [[Yavanna]] to bring to the peoples of Middle-earth; this was to be a token that the Valar had not forsaken them. He gave it to [[Galadriel]], and remarked prophetically that she would in turn pass it to an individual who would also be called [[Aragorn|Elessar]].<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>\n\n====Early vigilance====\nAround {{TA|1100}},<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> the Istari and the Eldar discovered that some evil entity resided at [[Dol Guldur]] in Mirkwood. Dark shapes moved in the forest and evil began to multiply in the woods. Some thought a [[Nazgûl]] had returned to torment the world, or some new evil was arising.  Gandalf was unsure, and feared that perhaps Sauron himself might have returned.<ref name=\"Rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n[[File:John Howe - Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nOver the next two hundred years the evil continued to grow, as well as the source directing it. [[Orcs]] were multiplying in the [[Misty Mountains]] and elsewhere. The [[Witch-king]], the mightiest of the Nazgûl, had built a fortress in [[Angmar]] in the Northern wastelands and waged unending war against the Kingdom of [[Arnor]]. Meanwhile [[Moria]] and [[Minas Ithil]] fell under a shadow, while other wars, plagues, and catastrophes occurred across Middle-earth. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur in {{TA|2063|n}} to discover its secret.<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> An entity known only as the '[[Necromancer]]' fled before him preventing Gandalf from identifying him.<ref name=\"Rings\" /> After Gandalf's incursion, the evil there seemed to desist, and its absence allowed for some centuries of calmness.\n\nThat peaceful period was known as the [[Watchful Peace]] and lasted for almost four hundred years. However, the Nazgûl had used this period to prepare for Sauron's return, which occurred in {{TA|2460|n}}.<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> Realising the returning evil, the [[Wise]] formed the [[White Council]] three years later. [[Galadriel]], bearer of one of the Three Elven Rings and mighty among the Eldar, wished Gandalf to be the chief of the Council, but he refused the position wishing to set down no roots and to maintain his independence; Saruman took this place because of his vast knowledge.<ref name=\"Rings\" />\n[[File:Miriam Ellis - The Long Winter, 1158 - Gandalf Helps the Hobbits.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|\"[[Long Winter|The Long Winter]], [[Third Age 2758|1158]]: Gandalf Helps the [[Hobbits]]\" by [[Miriam Ellis]]]]\nDuring his wanderings in [[Eriador]], Gandalf met and befriended the isolated and secretive people of the [[Hobbits]] in their country, [[The Shire]]. During the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2758|n}} Gandalf came to their aid.<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> It was then when he witnessed and admired the pity and courage the humble Hobbits reserved in their hearts.<ref name=\"Erebor\" /> \n\nWhen King [[Thráin|Thráin II]], a dwarf of the royal line of [[Lonely Mountain]], disappeared on a journey to [[Erebor]], Gandalf looked for him. At some point after {{TA|2845|n}} he entered the abandoned city of Khazad-dûm. After his vain search, the Wizard exited through the [[Doors of Durin]]; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.<ref name=\"journey\">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2850|n}}, his quest led him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy.<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> He found Thráin in the dungeons, who gave the Wizard his last possessions, the [[Thrór's Map|map]] and key to Erebor.<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref> Most importantly, Gandalf found that the Necromancer was no Nazgûl, but was Sauron himself, and he had taken [[Ring of Thrór|the last]] of the [[Seven Rings]] from the Dwarf King. Sauron was gathering the remaining [[Rings of Power]] and possibly searching for his lost [[The One Ring|One Ring]].\n\nGandalf escaped Dol Guldur and returned to the White Council.<ref name=\"Rings\" /> After relating his discoveries, he urged the council to attack Sauron while the One Ring was still lost and Sauron's power immature. But Saruman said that it was better to watch and wait, and that the One Ring had long ago rolled from [[Anduin]] to the Sea.<ref name=\"Rings\" /> The majority of the council agreed with Saruman. [[Elrond]] Half-elven, a powerful member of the council, later privately told Gandalf he had a foreboding that the Ring would be found, and that the war to end the [[Ages|Age]] was coming. Indeed, he added, he feared that it would end in darkness and despair. Gandalf encouraged him, saying there were many \"strange chances,\" and that, \"''help oft shall come from the hands of the weak when the Wise falter''\".<ref name=\"Rings\" /> Gandalf did not yet realise that Saruman now wanted the Ring for himself and was secretly searching for it along the banks of the river Anduin.\n\n====Quest for Erebor====\nGandalf would visit the Shire occasionally and participate in the [[Midsummer]]-eve parties of the [[Old Took]] where he impressed young Hobbits with his fireworks, and his stories about [[Dragons]], [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] and princesses.<ref name=\"Erebor\" /> He was thus known to be \"responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures\". He also met a relatively adventurous Hobbit named [[Bilbo Baggins]] although he was far from \"adventuresome.\"<ref name=\"Party\" />\n\nGandalf was concerned about the weak state of the North. [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] had destroyed both the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the town of [[Dale]], and Gandalf feared that [[Sauron]] might use the desolation around Erebor to regain the northern passes in the mountains and the old lands of Angmar. Gandalf knew that exiled Dwarf [[King of Durin's Folk]] [[Thorin Oakenshield]] planned to battle against Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In {{TA|2941|n}},<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> while staying the night in [[Bree]], Gandalf happened across the Dwarf King.<ref name=\"Erebor\">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. Gandalf was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as well. They found they were taking the same road for a while (Thorin passing through [[the Shire]] on his way to the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]]), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the Dragon Smaug with Thorin.\n[[File:David T. Wenzel - Good Morning Mr. Baggins.jpg|thumb|''Good Morning Mr. Baggins'' by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]\nUltimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a \"burglar\" of Gandalf's own choosing.  Gandalf had a feeling that a Hobbit should be involved, and he remembered Bilbo Baggins. At first he found only [[Holman Cotton]] as Bilbo had left on the occasion of the [[Yestare|Elven new year]], something that persuaded Gandalf that Bilbo was the right person for the job.<ref name=\"Erebor\" /> He visited Bilbo later, bringing along the kinsmen of Thorin.<ref name=\"Party\">{{H|Party}}</ref> In the end Gandalf convinced the reluctant Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin. \n\nGandalf accompanied [[Thorin and Company]] to [[Rivendell]]. Gandalf saved them from a trio of [[Stone-trolls]], and later obtained the legendary sword [[Glamdring]] from their [[Trolls|Troll]]-hoard; Gandalf bore it thenceforth.<ref name=\"Mutton\">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> He also helped Thorin and Company through the [[Misty Mountains]]. When they unknowingly camped in the [[Front Porch]] of the [[Goblin-town]], the Goblins captured the whole company except Gandalf, who surprised them much later by killing the [[Great Goblin]] and then rescuing the Dwarves and leading them to the exit.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{H|Hill}}</ref> It was during this time that Bilbo obtained a \"magic ring\".<ref name=\"Riddles\">{{H|Riddles}}</ref> The hobbit initially claimed he \"won\" it from the creature \"[[Gollum]]\" while the company was under the Misty Mountains,<ref name=\"Pan\">{{H|Pan}}</ref> and he kept it secret from Gandalf for some time. \n[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Lord of the Eagles.jpg|thumb|''The Lord of the Eagles'' by [[Darrell Sweet]]]]\nOn their escape out, the Company was saved by the [[Eagles]] of the Misty Mountains; Gandalf once had healed the [[Great Eagle]] from a poisoned wound,<ref name=\"Pan\" /> and thenceforth they became friends. The Eagles picked them up and flew them to their eyrie. The next day, they dropped them to the other side of the Mountains.<ref name=\"Pan\" />\n\nGandalf then sought the hospitality of [[Beorn]], persuading him to welcome and host the whole Company in his [[Beorn's Hall|hall]]. But then he left the quest prior to its completion; after leading the Company to the outskirts of the [[Forest Gate]], he gave them some final advice (but little did he know that the lands had changed by then) before they entered [[Mirkwood]], and went to attend other obligations.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> The [[White Council]] had met under the gravest of circumstances: Sauron's vast power was returning, even without his Ring. Gandalf at last convinced the Council to attack Dol Guldur, to which even Saruman agreed (as by now he feared Sauron as a rival, and wished to delay his search for the Ring). Gandalf joined his peers in assailing [[Dol Guldur]], ridding [[Mirkwood]] of the Necromancer's presence, who fled to [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"ThirdAge\">{{App|B2}}</ref> When he was about to finish his task, news about what happened to Thorin's Company in Mirkwood reached him, and he realised that the instructions he gave them did not help; they had lost their way, and then vanished from the imprisonment of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]], who had captured them. He was anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile Thorin's quest was successful: Erebor was retaken and Smaug was killed,<ref name=\"Fire\">{{H|Fire}}</ref> but when Gandalf finally arrived to the area, he found the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] and [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|the Iron Hills]] preparing for an attack by the [[Lake-men]] and the [[Elves of Mirkwood]]. He was with [[Bard]] and [[Thranduil]] and revealed his presence trying to reason with Thorin. When the attack was beginning, Gandalf halted them, to warn that the [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] were coming to claim the treasure. He invited [[Dáin Ironfoot]] for council, and soon Dwarves, Elves and Men formed an alliance, and defeated the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref name=\"Burst\">{{H|Burst}}</ref> \n\nKing Thorin was mortally wounded and after his funeral and the reestablishment of Erebor under Dáin, Bilbo and Gandalf left Erebor for the Shire; on the way, they celebrated [[Yule]] at Beorn's, and then returned to Rivendell, where Gandalf discussed with [[Elrond]] the events of Dol Guldur and the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf had accomplished his immediate goal, which was to destroy Smaug, who could have been used to disastrous effect by Sauron. A large number of Orcs and Wargs also were killed in the North, removing threats to Rivendell and Lothlórien.<ref name=\"Erebor\" /> But they both agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.<ref name=\"H19\">{{H|19}}</ref>\n\nAs Gandalf and Bilbo passed by the site of their former encounter with the stone-trolls, they recovered the gold of the troll-hoard they had buried.<ref name=\"H19\" /> \n\nGandalf was amazed by the hobbit; until then he had paid no attention to hobbits and knew little of them. For the rest of his sojourn in Middle-earth, Gandalf took a special interest in hobbits, and particularly in the Baggins family. [[Third Age 2949|Years later]], he and Balin paid a visit to Bilbo, discussing the news from Erebor and Dale.<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /><ref name=\"H19\" />\n\n====Return of the Shadow====\nDespite the Council's hopes, Sauron was not weakened by this attack. He had foreseen the move that drove him from Mirkwood, and his retreat was but a feint. Ten years after the attack, Sauron declared himself openly in Mordor in {{TA|2951|n}} and rebuilt [[Barad-dûr]]. The White Council met for one last time in {{TA|2953|n}} to debate about the [[Rings of Power]]. Saruman quieted his peers, claiming to have knowledge that the One Ring was lost in the [[Belegaer]]. After their meeting, Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; this would affect the peaceful Hobbits, as from this, Saruman discovered their existence and noted Gandalf's interest in the Shire. As a result, he started sending agents to [[Bree]] and the [[Southfarthing]].<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" />\n\n[[Gollum]] had come to Gandalf's knowledge, having left his hideout. He was looking for the thief of his ring: Bilbo. The [[Elves of Mirkwood]] had informed Gandalf that Gollum was traversing the forest. Then, coinciding with Sauron's declaration, Gollum apparently turned towards [[Mordor]] and was lost. Gandalf neglected the matter because he \"had much else to think of at that time\" and still trusted Saruman's knowledge. Later, Gandalf would regret this.<ref name=\"shadow\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Sauron began reassembling his forces for the final blow against the West. [[Easterlings]] from [[Khand]] and beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]], joined by men from [[Harad]] reinforced his stronghold in [[Mordor]]; Orcs, trolls, and other foul beasts were multiplying while his minions were searching the Anduin for any sign of his precious One Ring.\n\nGandalf met [[Aragorn]], the hidden [[Heir of Isildur]] in {{TA|2956|n}}, and soon became friends with him.<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> From that point on, Aragorn and Gandalf often worked together towards a common end - the defeat of Sauron.\n\nHe visited [[Minas Tirith]] and was welcomed by [[Faramir]], the son of the [[Ruling Steward]] [[Denethor]], and taught him from his wisdom. This displeased Denethor, who didn't trust Gandalf.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Michele Mantoani - Gandalf.jpg|thumb|\"Gandalf\" by [[:Category:Images by Michele Mantoani|Michele Mantoani]]]]\nDuring this period Gandalf visited the Shire frequently, especially his friend Bilbo Baggins, and his younger cousin, [[Frodo Baggins]]. He noted Bilbo's unusual youthfulness, despite his advancing age; the suspicious \"[[The One Ring|magic ring]]\" that Bilbo had acquired during his adventure began to weigh on his mind. Gandalf recalled the deceit Bilbo used in originally claiming it for his own — Bilbo had later admitted to stealing it from [[Gollum]]. Gandalf could see that Bilbo was very preoccupied with the ring. Such un-hobbitlike behaviour aroused his suspicions. In {{TA|3001|n}} he organised [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]], and before leaving the Shire, he convinced Bilbo to leave the Ring for Frodo. He then emphatically warned Frodo not to use it; Gandalf had begun to suspect that the \"magic ring\" was indeed a [[Ring of Power]].<ref name=\"party\">{{FR|Party}}</ref> Around that time, Gandalf became unpopular in the Shire; he was blamed for Bilbo's disappearance, and was even accused of plotting with Frodo to get a hold on Bilbo's wealth.<ref name=\"shadow\">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref><ref name=\"party\" />\n\nGandalf was keen to find out more about Bilbo's ring, so he left the Shire,<ref name=\"party\" /> and resumed his search for Gollum. In this, he sought the help of [[Aragorn]]. The [[Rangers of the North]] were put to guard the Shire more closely.<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> Gandalf showed up only [[Third Age 3004|three years later]] to check on Frodo and the Shire, and continued for the next four years always turning up unexpectedly and disappearing before dawn. In {{TA|3009|n}} he renewed the hunt for [[Gollum]] with Aragorn, searching in the [[vales of Anduin]], [[Mirkwood]], [[Rhovanion]], and even to the edges of Mordor. The search lasted eight years, for Gandalf did not know that Gollum had been captured by Sauron.<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> Gandalf regretted ignoring Gollum for so many years, as his trail had become cold, resulting in many dark and dangerous days for Gandalf.<ref name=\"shadow\" />\n\nStudying the records in [[Minas Tirith]], Gandalf found the [[Scroll of Isildur]] in {{TA|3017|n}}, and from this, pieced together the missing history of the One Ring. On his way back to the Shire, he got word from the [[Galadhrim]] that Aragorn had finally captured Gollum<ref name=\"ThirdAge\" /> and so he went to [[Mirkwood]] to meet him. For days he interrogated him in order to verify what he already knew. A great fear came over him when he learned that Gollum had been to [[Barad-dûr]]. Sauron had tortured Gollum and learned of the \"magic ring\", as well as the names \"Shire\" and \"Baggins\". The effects that Gandalf had seen on Gollum and Bilbo convinced him that Bilbo's Ring was not simply one of the [[Rings of Power]]: it was the ''[[The One Ring|One Ruling Ring]]'' of Sauron. Gandalf then returned in haste to the Shire.<ref name=\"shadow\" /><ref name=\"council\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\n====War of the Ring====\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Shadow of the Past.jpg|thumb|''The Shadow of the Past'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nGandalf returned to the Shire on [[12 April]] {{TA|3018}} and proved to Frodo that Bilbo's ring was the ancient [[One Ring]] which the Dark Power of [[Mordor]] was looking for. He told Frodo that he gathered much of this information by interrogating the creature [[Gollum]]. Frodo exclaimed that Gollum should have been killed, however Gandalf speculated that perhaps Gollum would have a part to play before the end, and in any case, it was not for Frodo to decide who should live and who should die.<ref name=\"shadow\" />\n\nGandalf suggested that he should leave the Shire soon and take the Ring to [[Rivendell]]. Frodo decided to leave on his next birthday, pretending to be moving to [[Buckland]], to which Gandalf agreed. The wizard stayed in the Shire for over two months,<ref name=\"three\">{{FR|Three}}</ref> during which time, on [[1 May]] he went to [[Sarn Ford]] and met again Aragorn, informing him of Frodo's plans.<ref name=\"FR|Strider\">{{FR|Strider}}</ref> He had a sense of foreboding and heard [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|disturbing news about war]] in [[Gondor]] and a [[Black Shadow]].<ref name=\"council\" /> He decided to leave for the South and left Frodo, promising to return for his birthday-farewell party in autumn, so that they would go to Rivendell together.<ref name=\"three\" /> \n\nHe wandered around [[Eriador]] hearing news from the refugees who had a fear they could not speak about, until he met [[Radagast]] who brought a message from [[Saruman]] that he must seek him at once, and a warning that the [[Ringwraiths]] were looking for the Shire.<ref name=\"council\" /> Gandalf went to [[the Prancing Pony]] at [[Bree]]. Believing that he would not be able to return to Frodo in time, he wrote [[Gandalf's letter|a letter]],<ref name=\"council\" /> urging him to move as soon as possible for Rivendell, and seek someone named \"Strider\", whose real name was Aragorn, with a [[Riddle of Strider|riddle]] to identify him; Gandalf would then try to catch up with them when he could. He instructed [[Barliman Butterbur]] to send the letter to [[Hobbiton]] and to expect a Mr. [[Baggins]] to arrive at the inn under the name of \"[[Mr. Underhill]]\". He left the inn, but Barliman would forget to send the letter.<ref name=\"FR|Strider\" />\n\n=====Treachery of Saruman=====\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf Escapes Upon Gwaihir.jpg|thumb|left|''Gandalf Escapes Upon Gwaihir'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nSoon thereafter, Gandalf arrived at Isengard. At their meeting, Saruman at last revealed his desire for the One Ring.<ref name=\"council\" /> He offered to his \"''old friend and helper''\" that they take the Ring for themselves and seize power from Sauron.  Gandalf rejected this with horror, and was imprisoned by Saruman on the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]]. [[Gwaihir]], chief of the Eagles, soon arrived and helped Gandalf escape.<ref name=\"council\" /> Gandalf knew he needed to return quickly to the Shire, as Frodo (and the Ring) were in grave danger from both Sauron's Nazgûl and Saruman's treacherous desire for the Ring.\n\nGandalf hurriedly went to [[Rohan]], desiring to find a strong steed; there he obtained [[Shadowfax]] from King [[Théoden]], who later resented the gift.<ref name=\"council\" /> This lord of horses and Gandalf forged a special bond, and Gandalf made quick use of Shadowfax's incredible strength and endurance.\n\nGandalf sped to the Shire. Fortunately, Frodo had already left the Shire without waiting for Gandalf,<ref name=\"council\" /> and was seeking [[Rivendell]]. Upon his arrival, Gandalf learned that the Nazgûl, arrayed as [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], had been searching the area. Dismayed, he set out for Bree; Barliman apologised to Gandalf for forgetting to send the letter,  and was worried that the hobbits had left with Strider, the suspicious [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]]. But for Gandalf, this was a hope which far exceeded his expectations. After congratulating a puzzled Barliman, Gandalf slept the night at the inn and in the morning left for [[Weathertop]], a high point in the region, to observe the surrounding area.<ref name=\"council\" /> \n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Fire on Weathertop.jpg|thumb|''Fire on Weathertop'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThere he was assaulted at night by the Nazgûl, but drove them off after a great battle of light and flame.<ref name=\"B3\">{{App|B3}}</ref> These phenomena were seen by Aragorn and the hobbits from afar, although they were unaware that Gandalf was involved.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> Before leaving Weathertop, he marked some stones with the [[cirth|certh]] G for them to find. The next day he escaped to the north, followed by four Riders.<ref name=\"council\" />\n\nHe then went directly to Rivendell, arriving a few  days sooner than [[Aragorn]].<ref name=\"B3\" /> But when they arrived, Gandalf and Elrond joined their powers to cause a flood in [[Bruinen]] to drown the Riders, allowing Frodo some time to reach Rivendell.<ref name=\"council\" /> Then they welcomed Glorfindel, Aragorn and the hobbits upon their arrival. Frodo was sick with a [[Morgul-wound]], but was still in possession of the Ring.\n\n=====Fellowship of the Ring=====\nElrond called a [[Council of Elrond|Council]] after Frodo was healed to consider the momentous decision of what would be done with the Ring. By chance, representatives of most of the free peoples were in Rivendell for various reasons. Elrond and Gandalf advised that the Ring should be destroyed in the fires of [[Orodruin]], where it was made. Others dissented or objected, but they eventually submitted to Gandalf's plan. Ultimately, Elrond appointed the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] as nine walkers, numerically set against Sauron's nine Nazgûl. The relatively small number reflected the realisation by Elrond and the other council members that the quest of Mount Doom would not rely upon strength of arms, but on stealth and good fortune. Gandalf was chosen to lead the company, which included [[Aragorn]], [[Boromir]], [[Legolas]] the Elf, [[Gimli]] the Dwarf, and the hobbits Frodo Baggins, who was named the [[Ring-bearer]], and [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]].<ref name=\"council\" />\n\nSeveral obstacles stood in the company's way. The vast [[Misty Mountains]] had to be crossed, for Gandalf was determined not to lead the company near [[Isengard]]. Gandalf decided to take a southern route to the [[Redhorn Pass]] and there to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] near [[Caradhras]], thereby traversing the mountain range and avoiding Isengard.<ref name=\"The Ring Goes South, p. 283\">{{FR|South}}, p. 283</ref> When this attempt failed due to a terrible storm, he decided to take the Fellowship through the ruins of Moria, where the remains of the great Dwarven city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] were now a labyrinth of tunnels under the mountains. Others in the company were loath to enter the maze, as it was now the lair of orcs and something known only as \"Durin's Bane\".\n\nAt the [[Doors of Durin]] on the west side of the mountains, Gandalf, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Moria on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], where Gandalf read the [[Book of Mazarbul|Book of Records]], which revealed the fate of [[Balin]], the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Moria. Soon after, the party was attacked by orcs, and forced to flee the chamber. By then, Gandalf was well aware of their location and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.\n[[File:John Howe - Gandalf Falls with the Balrog.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf Falls with the Balrog'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nHowever, [[Durin's Bane]] caught up to the group at the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]. Gandalf and Legolas immediately realised what it was: a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] of [[Morgoth]]. Gandalf faced the demon and broke the bridge upon which they both stood, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm.  But the Balrog's whip lashed out, and grasped Gandalf by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Gandalf shouted \"Fly, you fools\" and vanished into the abyss.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n\nYet Gandalf did not die; he and the Balrog fought long in the bowels and deep places of [[Arda]]. After restless pursuit over the course of eight days, Gandalf and the beast finally came to the summit of the [[Endless Stair]] upon the peak of [[Celebdil]]. There, he [[Battle of the Peak|fought the demon]] for two days and nights. The Balrog had burst into flame anew when it exited the stairs; ice, wind, and smoke swirled about them as they duelled. Gandalf used his last measure of strength to slay the Balrog, throwing him down the mountainside in ruin. Gandalf's spirit then left his body, having sacrificed himself to save the Fellowship.\n\n=====Gandalf the White=====\nBut Gandalf's spirit did not depart Middle-earth forever. As the only one of the five Istari to stay true to his errand, Olórin was sent back to mortal lands by [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], and he became Gandalf once again. Yet, as he was now the sole emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth, he was granted the power to \"reveal\" more of his inner [[Maiar]] strength.<ref>{{L|156}}</ref> This naked power that lay within him was seldom used during the remainder of his time in Middle-earth, as his mission was essentially the same: to support and succour those who opposed Sauron. Nevertheless, when Gandalf's wrath was kindled his \"unveiled\" strength was such that few of Sauron's servants could withstand him.\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf Returns.jpg|thumb|left|''Gandalf Returns'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nAs he lay on the mountaintop, the great eagle [[Gwaihir]] came up and bore him to [[Lothlórien]], where he was clothed and replenished, and given a new staff by [[Galadriel]]. Gandalf soon learned that Frodo had left the Fellowship and was travelling to Mount Doom. As Frodo was beyond his assistance now, Gandalf promptly went south to [[Fangorn Forest]], where he met the [[Three Hunters]]: [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], and gave them messages from Galadriel. From them, he learned that Sam went with Frodo, and he was pleased with this.<ref name=\"TT White\" />{{rp|496}} Then he called forth [[Shadowfax]], and rode with them to [[Edoras]]. There he found that Saruman's spy [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] had deceived King [[Théoden]] into hopeless impotence. Gandalf quickly deposed Wormtongue and encouraged Théoden to ride west to war against [[Saruman]]. By now, Gandalf was keenly aware that the great war to end the age was beginning; if Saruman conquered Rohan, then Gondor would be alone with enemies on all sides.\n\nAt Gandalf's encouragement, King Théoden went west to Helm's Deep where he was quickly besieged; Gandalf then searched for [[Erkenbrand]] and the forces of the [[Westfold]], which he later found and led to the Deep, thus breaking the siege. Meanwhile, the [[Ents]], along with the hobbits Merry and Pippin, moved against Saruman and sent [[Huorns]] against the orcs, resulting in the utter ruin of the outer walls of [[Isengard]] and the complete annihilation of Saruman's orcs. After the battle, Gandalf went to [[Orthanc]] with Théoden, Aragorn, and a small group. There Saruman rejected Gandalf's offer of forgiveness with contempt. Gandalf then broke Saruman's staff and cast him from the Order and the Council.<ref name=\"TT Voice\" />{{rp|583}} Gandalf imposed a strict watch on Isengard by the Ents and then advised King Théoden to ride to Gondor's defence as soon as possible. The wizard's mind had already turned to Gondor and the coming climactic battle in the east.\n\n=====Siege of Minas Tirith=====\n[[File:Donato Giancola - The White Rider.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|''The White Rider'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]] \nAs a 'reward' for Pippin, who had foolishly gazed into a [[Palantíri|palantír]], Gandalf took the Hobbit with him to [[Minas Tirith]], the last bastion of the west. Soon after arriving, Gandalf confronted [[Denethor|Denethor II]], the [[Ruling Steward]], and learned that he was near despair over the death of his eldest son, [[Boromir]]. Pippin entered the Steward's service in payment of the debt that he and Merry owed: the death of Boromir. Ostensibly they were allies, but the Steward treated him with disrespect and suspicion. When [[Faramir]], the Steward's younger son, returned from [[Osgiliath]] and was attacked by Nazgûl, Gandalf upon Shadowfax drove them away by revealing the power within him. Later, Faramir told him that Frodo and Sam were still alive and headed towards Mordor.<ref name=\"RK Siege\">{{RK|Siege}}</ref>{{rp|812}}\n\nThe city was soon besieged by a vast force from Mordor, led by the [[Witch-king]]. An ill-advised counterattack resulted in Faramir receiving a wound from a poisoned dart; he lay near death inside the Tower. Still, Gandalf encouraged the men of Minas Tirith to have hope, and dispelled the fear of the Ringwraiths by his very presence.  But Sauron's catapults hurled flaming bolts upon the city; soon the first circle of the city burned unchecked. Denethor then lost all heart as the city burned and his only remaining son hovered near death. He abandoned his leadership of the city, and Gandalf then took it upon himself to direct the defence of the city. When the gigantic battering ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] destroyed the ancient entrance to the city, Gandalf placed himself alone at the ruined gateway. The Witch-king then appeared in the midst of the blasted gate upon a black horse and threatened Gandalf with death; but Gandalf did not move — seated upon Shadowfax he defied the mightiest of Sauron's minions. However, the stand-off ended inconclusively, as the morning arrived along with the host of the Rohirrim. Hearing the horns of the [[Riders of Rohan]], the Witch-king departed.\n\nHowever, Gandalf did not pursue his foe, for Pippin brought him news that Denethor was about to burn himself and his son Faramir to death on a pyre like the heathen kings of old. Gandalf rushed to stop this, and was able to save Faramir, but not Denethor, whose despair and grief had overcome his mind. Gandalf then learned how it was that Denethor's will had been broken: the Steward clutched a palantír in his hands as he burned.\n\nNevertheless, and against all hope, the siege was broken. [[Éowyn]] of Rohan and Merry defeated the Witch-king, whose last wail was heard by many as he was reduced to impotence. Soon after, Aragorn arrived with a large host of men from the southern fiefs upon a captured pirate fleet from Umbar. The forces of the men of the west then utterly defeated Sauron's attack against Minas Tirith, relieving the city and killing virtually all of the invaders. Gandalf's carefully laid plans and words of wisdom, along with acts of heroism not seen since the [[Elder Days]], had defeated Sauron's first move.\n\n=====Last battle=====\nBut the attack against Minas Tirith was only a part of Sauron's plan to devastate the West and make himself the ruler of Middle-earth. Other armies moved in the north against [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the Kingdom of Thranduil, as well as against Lothlórien and other points along the [[Anduin]]. Still commanding vast armies of orcs and men, the Dark Lord soon would move against Gondor again; the remnants of the Edain and their allies had little hope against his almost limitless resources. \n\nIn Minas Tirith, Gandalf was selected by Aragorn, [[Imrahil]], and [[Éomer]] (the remaining lords of the west) to be their leader in the coming final battles. This would be the culmination of Gandalf's efforts in Middle-earth. Fully aware that the West would stand or fall on the outcome of Frodo's mission, he advised the lords to drive north to the [[Morannon]], thereby drawing Sauron's eye away from Frodo's likely location. This plan would likely result in a catastrophic loss for the outnumbered army, but it gave Frodo a chance to achieve the quest of Mount Doom.\n\nLed by Gandalf and Aragorn, the army of the West crossed the Anduin and marched north, pausing occasionally to announce their coming, and to dispatch small numbers of men to lesser tasks. Upon arriving at the Black Gate, the forces halted and prepared for battle. As they ordered their companies, the foul [[Mouth of Sauron]] rode forth to parley with them; he revealed Frodo's [[Mithril-coat]] and [[Barrow-blade]] and implied that their owner was captured and tortured. The emissary of Sauron then proposed that the forces of the west surrender; Gandalf however was undaunted, and, seizing his friend's belongings, rejected Sauron's offer. In shock, the Mouth of Sauron turned back towards the Black Gate, which slowly opened to reveal a vast army of orcs and trolls advancing on the lords of the west. Sauron's trap was sprung.\n\nYet Sauron himself became the victim of Gandalf's trap. Unbeknownst to all, Frodo and Sam had succeeded in scaling Mount Doom. Even as the Battle of Morannon began, Frodo stood at the [[Crack of Doom]]. But the power and lure of the Ring finally overcame his will and he placed the ring upon his finger, claiming it as his own. Immediately the Nazgûl were summoned by their lord, as he in terror realised his blunder: his enemies intended to destroy his Ring.\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Shadow of Sauron.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Shadow of Sauron'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nBut Gandalf's foresight proved accurate again as the creature Gollum, who had been doggedly following the Ring-bearer, seized the Ring from Frodo, and, while celebrating his reunion with \"his precious,\" unwittingly fell into the fires of Orodruin. The ring was unmade as the fiery mountain erupted. The tower of [[Barad-dûr]] and the [[Towers of the Teeth]] began to collapse, their foundations crumbling. The Ring-wraiths burned out like shooting stars, and Sauron was reduced to a mere shadow of malice, never to torment the world again.\n\nWith Sauron gone, his forces scattered; the Men of the West now set upon them with fury. Gandalf announced the success of the [[Ring-bearer]] and the end of Sauron; the quest had been fulfilled.  Seeing that victory was achieved, Gandalf then mounted [[Gwaihir]] the Eagle for the third time, and set out for Mount Doom in search of Frodo and Sam. To his great relief, the two were found on the slopes of Orodruin, clinging to life amid the volcanic eruptions.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>{{rp|948–51}} The great quest was over.\n\n====End of the Order====\nIn Minas Tirith, Gandalf and the remaining members of the Fellowship reunited. At the coronation of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]], Gandalf, at Aragorn's request, set the crown upon the King’s head, and declared \"''Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the [[Valar]] endure!''\". Thus Gandalf ushered in the new age of men.\n\nAfter the coronation and wedding of Aragorn to [[Arwen]], Gandalf left with the rest of the remaining Fellowship on the journey home. For Gandalf, it was his last long journey in Middle-earth. His errand to Arda had been fulfilled; Sauron had been defeated. He said farewell to his friends one by one until at last only the four Hobbits remained at his side. At the borders of the Shire he, too, turned away. He left the Hobbits to settle the affairs of the Shire themselves, for the shattered pieces of evil still remaining in the world were no longer his concern, and went to talk to [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>{{rp|996}}\n[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - At the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|\"At the Gray Havens\" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]\nWhat Gandalf did during the next two years is unknown; it is possible that his \"''long talk''\" with Bombadil was just that. At any rate, on [[29 September]] {{TA|3021|n}}, he met [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] at [[Mithlond]], ready to take the [[White Ship]] over the [[Belegaer|sea]] to [[Aman]].  He wore [[Narya]] openly on his finger, and Shadowfax was beside him (perhaps even to take ship with him). His mission was over, and his homecoming after more than 2000 years was nigh. He bade farewell to [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] (the later two of whom he had forewarned of the passage), then boarded the ship beside Frodo, Bilbo, Elrond, and Galadriel. The ship passed west upon the sea,<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> and then took the hidden straight path to [[Valinor]]. Gandalf became Olórin once more. There, presumably, he dwells still in the gardens of [[Irmo]]. Olórin, the wisest of the Maiar and the sole Istar to remain true to his mission, had successfully kindled the hearts of the [[free peoples]] of Middle-earth to overcome the evil of their time. <!--In a large way, it was his victory.-->\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Personality===\n[[File:Roger Garland - Gandalf.jpg|left|thumb|The Grey Pilgrim relaxing. Art by [[Roger Garland]]]]\nGandalf is often described in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as quick to anger, and equally quick to laugh.<ref name=\"Lorien\">{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> He had great pity and patience, even extending to the servants of his enemies. He is said to have learned both from Nienna in Valinor.<ref name=\"vala\" />\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - G for Gandalf.png|thumb|Gandalf's signature, the [[cirth|rune]] \"G\".]]\nKeen observers of Gandalf often detected a veiled power, usually revealed in his eyes, which appeared deep and wise.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref>{{rp|757}} He was alternately affectionate and brusque; he often surprised others with his bluntness when time was of the essence. Gandalf consistently upbraided foolish behaviour, but also richly rewarded those who acted with good intentions.\n\nHobbits appealed to him more than to the other Wizards, and he often went to the Shire for respites from his errands. It may be that he was amused by their nature. It may also be because they were untouched by the great evils of the world, and were more in touch with nature than Men; perhaps their agrarian lifestyle appealed to Gandalf's innate spirit and reminded him of the gardens of Valinor.\n\n[[Círdan]] the Shipwright divined in him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" out of all of the Wizards that came from the West, and so he entrusted the care of [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves, to Gandalf rather than to Saruman.<ref name=\"Istari\" />\n\n===Appearance===\n[[File:John Howe - Gandalf the Grey 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[John Howe]]]]\n\nThe first description of Gandalf is preserved in the initial pages of ''The Hobbit'', written in the early 1930s. Gandalf's fame is alluded to even before his physical description (\"Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion\"), while the protagonist's (\"unsuspecting Bilbo\") impression is that of:\n{{Blockquote|...an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', \"[[An Unexpected Party]]\"}}\n\nLater, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote: \n{{Blockquote|...a figure strongly built and with broad shoulder, though shorter than the average of men and now stooped with age, leaning on a thick rough-cut staff as he trudged along... Gandalf's hat was wide-brimmed [...] with a pointed conical crown, and it was ''blue''; he wore a long ''grey'' cloak, but this would not reach much below his knees. It was of an elven silver-grey hue, though tarnished by wear - as is evident from the general use of grey in [[The Lord of the Rings|the book]]... But his colours were always white, silver-grey, and blue - except for the boots he wore when walking in the wild...Gandalf even bent must have been at least 5 ft. 6... Which would make him a short man even in modern England, especially with the reduction of a bent back.<ref name=\"MB\" />}}\n\nAlthough some of the Wise knew his true nature, his \"wizard-like\" appearance caused many to mistake him for a simple conjurer. After his return, his \"signature colour\" changed from grey to white, for he had been sent back to replace the corrupt Saruman as the chief of the Wizards. In the book, he claimed that, in some ways, he now \"was Saruman\", or rather Saruman as he should have been.<ref name=\"TT White\" />{{rp|495}}\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n[[File:Roger Thomasson - Gandalf the Grey.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[Roger Thomasson]]]]\nGandalf demonstrated extensive knowledge of the land and an assortment of magical abilities from trivial to essential. \n\nGandalf was the bearer of [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, and described himself as the \"servant of the [[Secret Fire]]\" and \"wielder of the [[flame of Anor]]\".<ref name=\"bridge\" /> Many of Gandalf's displays of power were related to fire in some way. It is not known, though, whether or to what extent his possession of Narya affected his abilities.\n\nHe created blinding flashes and other pyrotechnics to distract the [[Orcs|goblins]] of the [[Misty Mountains]] during Thorin and Company's escape from [[Goblin-town]]. On the eastern slopes, he turned pine cones into flaming projectiles that threw hot sparks and started fires that would not easily go out.\n\nWhen the Fellowship was attacked by [[Wargs]] in [[Eregion|Hollin]], Gandalf spoke words of power to inflame the trees on the hillock where the company had camped. While crossing the Misty Mountains with the Fellowship, he was able to start fires under blizzard conditions. On the journey through Moria he created lights of varying intensity, magically secured doors, and broke the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]. He fought and killed the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog of Moria]], although he did not himself survive the battle.<ref name=\"bridge\" />\n\nSent back to [[Middle-earth]] as Gandalf the White, he possessed greater charisma and a limited degree of clairvoyance, although he was unable to peer into the land of [[Mordor]] to see the progress of Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]. His power and authority had increased so that he could break [[Saruman]]'s staff with a spoken command, throw the treacherous wizard out of the order.<ref name=\"TT Voice\">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>{{rp|583}} He also prevented Sauron's Eye from locating Frodo.<ref name=\"TT White\">{{TT|White}}</ref>\n\nHe frequently used his powers for entertainment. He blew glowing smoke rings that moved around the room at his direction, and was known among Hobbits for his fireworks displays,<ref name=\"Erebor\" /> for example at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref name=\"party\" />\n\nWhen angered or aroused for battle, he seemed to grow in height and assume a terrifying aspect.<ref name=\"party\" />{{rp|34}} \n\nThough not as keen as [[Elves]], his eyesight was sharp enough to see in darkness, and into the [[Unseen]].\n\n===Special equipment===\nIt is unknown whether Gandalf required his staff to exercise certain powers. At times it appeared to focus or extend his powers, such as its emanation of light. [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] tried to forbid Gandalf from bringing it into [[Edoras]] in a clear attempt to limit his powers.<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>{{rp|514}}\n\nWhen he arrived in Middle-earth, Gandalf received the Elven ring [[Narya]] from [[Círdan]].<ref name=\"Istari\" /> Gandalf wore it from that time to the end of the Third Age, but how he used its powers is not known.\n\nIn {{TA|2941}}, Gandalf acquired the Elven sword [[Glamdring]] from the treasure hoard of a band of trolls.<ref name=\"Mutton\" /> He continued to wield this weapon throughout ''The Lord of the Rings'', in particular during his fight with the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] in Moria.\n\nThroughout his time in Middle-earth Gandalf was often seen with a pipe which he used to smoke [[Old Toby]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Gandalf.mp3|Ardamir}}\n{{Pronounce|Quenya - Olórin.mp3|Gilgamesh}}\n''Gandalf'' is a [[North Germanic languages|Norse]] name and supposedly means \"Elvish wight with a (magic) staff\", for it contains the element ''gandr'' (\"a staff, especially one used in 'magic'\").

He came to regret the creation of this \"rabble of eddaic-named dwarves [...] invented in an idle hour\",<ref>{{TI|Runes}}, p. 452</ref> since it forced him to come up with an explanation of why Old Norse names should be used in [[Third Age]] Middle-earth. He solved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that [[Old Norse]] was a ''translation'' of the [[language of Dale]]. The figure of Gandalf has other influences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation as \"the Wanderer\", an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff: Tolkien states that he thinks of Gandalf as an ''\"Odinic wanderer\"'' in a letter of 1946.<ref>{{L|107}}</ref>\n\nTolkien had a postcard labelled ''[[Der Berggeist]]'' (\"the mountain spirit\"), and on the paper cover in which he kept it, he wrote \"the origin of Gandalf\" at some point. The postcard reproduces a painting of a bearded figure, sitting on a rock under a pine tree in a mountainous setting. He wears a wide-brimmed round hat and a long cloak and a white fawn is nuzzling his upturned hands.\n[[Humphrey Carpenter]] in his 1977 biography said that Tolkien had bought the postcard during his 1911 holiday in Switzerland. However, Manfred Zimmerman discovered that the painting was by German artist Josef Madlener and dates to the late 1920s.<ref>[[Manfred Zimmermann]], \"The Origin of Gandalf and Josef Madlener\", in ''[[Mythlore]]'' [[Mythlore 34|34]] (Winter [[1983]])</ref> Carpenter concluded that Tolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard himself.

Later, Frodo recieves [[The One Ring|Bilbo's ring]] as a birthday present and asks Gandalf about its purpose, having previously seen Biblo disappear with it. Gandalf tells Frodo of the forging of 20 magical rings and asks whether there are any marks on Bilbo's. Gandalf throws it into the fireplace, which reveals [[Ring-inscription|text]] on the ring, confirming Gandalf's suspicion that Bilbo's ring is indeed [[The One Ring]]. He encourages Frodo to bring the ring to [[Rivendell]] and participate in the [[Council of Elrond]]. He was imprisoned by [[Saruman|Saruman the Whute]] on [[Orthanc|his highest tower]] and was able to escape by sending a message to the birds and being rescued by the [[Eagles|Eagle]] [[Gwahir]].

When looking for one, he discovers a a majestic white horse, named [[Shadowfax]] by the [[Men]] of Rohan. Gandalf notes his beauty, speed and the fact that that no man had ever rode him. Gandalf tames him and rides him to the Shire. He narrowly misses the Hobbits who are in the [[Old Forest]]. Gandalf, unable to meet with the Frodo, and his Hobbit friends who agree to accompany him, at the ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]'', writes Frodo a letter, confirming that the man known as Strider is called [[Aragorn]] and is a man to be trusted. Finally arriving at the Prancing Pony, he hears word that Frodo had set off and he spends the night. The next day, [[Bree]] is stormed by [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] and Gandalf pursues them on Shadowfax to [[Weathertop]]. He arrives at Rivendell 3 days before Frodo. When Frodo arrives, he is comatosed by his encounter with the Black Riders. He greets Frodo when he recovers, 4 days after the Hobbit's arrival in Rivendell. He reunites with the Hobbits at the Council in Rivendell and tells the Council members of his journey. He agrees to join the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], which aims to bring the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it. The Fellowship sets off with Gandalf leading the group.

Gandalf's story starts with a conversation between Gandalf and [[Théoden]], after which the story goes back to the [[Caradhras]], where the Fellowship tries to travel over the  [[Misty Mountains]]. When that road fails, the Fellowship goes back and travels through [[Moria]]. In Moria Gandalf and the other member of the Fellowship are separated.

The first is the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]], which serves as a training mission. He has to fight [[Uruk-Hai]] in the forest of [[Huorns]] and [[Ents]] in \"The Road to Isengard\". After that, the missions move to [[Minas Tirith]]: the first mission, \"Top of the Wall\", has Gandalf warding off ladders and siege towers. In the second, \"Courtyard\", he has to protect civilians from the invading Orcs. His last playing mission is the [[Battle of the Morannon|Battle of the Black Gate]].\n\n'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (Game Boy Advance)]]:'''\n:Just like on the console version of the game, Gandalf is a playable character. He has many missions, collectively called the \"The Journey of the Wizard\". He starts in a flooded [[Isengard]], where he has to kill several [[Uruk-hai]] and [[Crebain]] before he confronts [[Saruman]]. After the defeat of Saruman he travels to [[Minas Tirith]] through Rohan and the Misty Mountains. At the [[Pelennor Fields]] Gandalf has to protect the [[Beacons of Gondor|beacons]], so Rohan can be warned. During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Minas Tirith]] he has to protect the gate, before making his way to the [[House of the Stewards|Steward's Tomb]].

In his battle against Durin's Bane, he is aided by the main characters.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Gandalf is voiced by [[Steven M. Kramer]], renowned for playing older mentor types.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:In non-storyline skirmishes Gandalf is the hero of the Gondor faction, who possesses several magical abilities. At first, he appears as Gandalf \"the Grey\", and becomes \"Gandalf the White\" after reaching level 5 (out of 10). Gandalf also narrates the prologue scene, repeating almost word for word the lines said by Galadriel in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.\n\n:His involvement in the storyline is notable for major differences from the original tale. First of all, Gandalf survives his encounter with Balrog, defeating him at the Bridge of Khazad-dum and continues the journey with the Fellowship - by the time of arrival in Lothlorien he already appears as Gandalf the White. He is present during the ambush at [[Amon Hen]], where thanks to his involvement Boromir is saved from certain death. Merry and Pippin are captured regardless and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir give chase, while Gandalf departs them to see to dealings in Rohan, including freeing of King Théoden from the spell. Following the Battle of Helm's Deep he travels to Minas Tirith along with both Pippin and Boromir, where they participate in the Siege of the city.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Gandalf is a hero for the \"Men of the West\" faction. Similar to the first game, he appears as Gandalf the Grey initially and Gandalf the White after level 5. He plays no part in the main storyline, but appears in the alternate \"evil\" campaign: after Sauron reclaims the Ring and lays waste to southern lands, Gandalf and few other survivors meet their end during a last stand in Rivendell.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Gandalf is a non-playable character voiced by [[Harry Chase]], who narrates cutscenes and instances throughout the original game, before the first expansion. He first meets the Dwarven characters in Ered Luin in {{TA|2941}}, shortly before the Quest for Erebor. Later, characters of all races meet him in Bree in October of {{TA|3018}}, but he is too busy with concerns for Frodo and the Ring and merely sends them away to find Radagast. Finally, the players have a chance to have a proper conversation with him in Rivendell, following the Council of Elrond. During that time, Gandalf is involved in several quests, including helping the player wreck havoc among the Goblins stirring at the [[High Pass]]. After the Fellowship leaves Rivendell, players are able to retrace many of their steps, including the marks left by Gandalf such as the Burnt Top in [[Eregion]] and the remains of his fire at the pass of [[Caradhras]]. Later, Lady [[Galadriel]] bids the player to find the signs of Gandalf following his fall from the Bridge of Khazad-dum - said signs include his burnt hat at the Foundations of Stone in Moria and the signs of his struggle with the Balrog at the [[Endless Stair]] - those allow Galadriel to discern that Mithrandir is not truly dead. Players later meet him as Gandalf the White in [[Caras Galadhon]] shortly after the Fellowship has departed Lothlorien. During that time, he engages into a spiritual battle with a Gaunt-Lord Gortheron the Doom-Caller; his display of his new abilities encourages the band of Free People players and allows them to defeat the servant of Sauron.\n\n:Gandalf is also present in several historic \"session plays\", during which players witness the important events their characters were not present for. Such events include Gandalf infiltrating [[Dol Guldur]] with the help of an Elf named Raddir, first meeting between Gandalf and Aragorn on the outskirts of Lothlorien and Gandalf's imprisonment atop Orthanc by Saruman.\n\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''\n:[[Martin Jarvis]] provides the voice of Gandalf. He is a playable mage hero and has three special powers: \"Healing Wisdom\", \"You Shall not Pass!\" and \"Cleansing Fire\". In the good campaign he appears at the end of the Isengard mission, where he has to kill Saruman in [[Orthanc]]. In Moria he can be played to destroy the [[Balrog]] and in Minas Tirith he has to defend the gates of the second ring. He is also one of the four playable heroes in the last mission, [[The Battle of the Morannon|the battle of the Black Gate]]. He appears as well at the end of the last mission, the Shire, of the evil campaign, in which he is defeated by [[Sauron]].\n:He is also playable in the Shire, Isengard, Minas Tirith and Moria with the ''Conquest'' Mode, in Isengard and Minas Tirith in the ''Team Deathmatch'' mode, the citadel of Minas Tirith in ''Capture the Ring'' mode, and at the Black Gate, Minas Morgul, Mount Doom and the Shire during ''Hero Team Deathmatch'' mode.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Gandalf is voiced by [[Tom Kane]], who also narrates the introduction of the game. He tells that heroes like \"[[Aragorn|Aragorn the King]]\", \"[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo the Ringbearer]]\" and \"'''Gandalf the Wizard'''\" are rightly honoured, but that without a few heroes - [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] - the north of [[Middle-earth]] would have been lost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>\n:He also appears in [[Rivendell]] later in the game.

During this epic quest, he bore [[the One Ring]] to [[Mount Doom]] and there destroyed it, giving him renown like no other [[Hobbits|Halfling]] throughout [[Middle-earth]]. He is also peculiar for being, as a [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], one of the only three Hobbits to be granted passage from Middle-earth to [[Aman]], the [[Undying Lands]].\n\n==History==\n===Childhood and youth===\nFrodo, child of the respectable [[Drogo Baggins]] and [[Primula Brandybuck]], was born on [[22 September]] of {{TA|2968}}. After his parents died in a boating accident in {{TA|2980|n}}, Frodo went to live in [[Brandy Hall]] with his mother’s relatives, the [[Brandybucks]]. He grew up under the guardianship of the [[Master of Buckland]] [[Rorimac Brandybuck|Rorimac \"Goldfather\" Brandybuck]], who was his maternal uncle. Frodo was caught several times stealing [[mushrooms]] from [[Farmer Maggot]], who, on the last incident, thrashed Frodo and set his three dogs to chase Frodo from [[Bamfurlong]] to [[Bucklebury Ferry]]. Frodo was terrified of them afterwards.<ref>{{FR|14}}: \"''though I daresay the beasts knew their business...''\"</ref>\n\nFrodo stayed in Buckland until his \"uncle\" [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] adopted him and took him in to live in [[Bag End]], Bilbo's house in [[Hobbiton]]. He enjoyed life with Bilbo, with whom he shared the same birthday - though others often called the old hobbit \"queer.\" Bilbo taught him to read, and told him stories of the past, even giving him some instruction in the [[elvish]] tongue. Frodo was the only one Bilbo allowed to read [[There and Back Again|his memoirs]]. Bilbo made Frodo his heir, frustrating the attempts of the disagreeable [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Baggins]]es, who coveted the estate of Bag End.<ref name=\"party\">{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\nThe two went often out for long walks along the lanes of the [[Water-valley]] and talked about adventure; they were sometimes seen by [[Wandering Companies]] of [[Elves]], though the hobbits did not see them. When they returned home, Bilbo would tell Frodo that the Road is like a massive river, and all porches are its \"springs\" and all paths are its \"tributaries\".<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>\n\nFrodo and Bilbo were comfortable and well off until {{TA|3001}}. At this time, Bilbo threw an enormous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|party]] to celebrate his 111th birthday, and Frodo's 33rd, the date of Frodo's coming of age. At this party Bilbo gave his farewell speech, and made his long-planned \"disappearance\" and withdrawal from [[the Shire]]. Frodo, who had been informed beforehand of the \"joke\", as Bilbo called it, was spared the shock that afflicted the other assembled Hobbits. Frodo returned home as the new Master of Bag End, as per [[Bilbo's will]]. He was greeted there by [[Gandalf]], who informed him that, among other things, Frodo had inherited Bilbo's [[One Ring|magic ring]].\n\n===Master of Bag End===\n[[File:Eric Faure-Brac - Bag End.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Bag End'' by Eric Faure-Brac]]\nFrodo took charge of distributing the presents Bilbo had left for the other hobbits, a long and tiring task. Then [[Gandalf]] the [[Wizards|wizard]], who had come for the festivities, warned Frodo not to use the magic ring, and to keep it secret and safe. Then he left, Frodo knew not where, with his mind full of curiosity about the ring. A suspicion was growing in the back of the Wizard's mind, but Gandalf did not yet know what it was.\n\nFrodo, meanwhile, was quite well off. He continued honouring Bilbo every year along with his own birthday. He had also inherited some strange customs from Bilbo, like wandering by himself at nights far from home in the hills and woods under the starlight. His closest friends at this time were [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], also [[Folco Boffin]] and [[Fredegar Bolger]], and other cousins from the family of the [[Old Took]]. Like Bilbo, Frodo continued to look robust and energetic even in his forties, and dreamed of one day seeing mountains and wilderness; he often wondered what lay beyond the borders of the Shire, and as he grew older, he would travel further and further from home. His friends were worried, and suspected that he met [[Elves]] and other strangers that had begun to be more common sights in the Shire. These strangers bore strange tales of unrest from lands far-off.<ref name=\"shadow\">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>\n\nStill, he lived in peace and respectability for seventeen years, until Gandalf returned with the dreadful revelation that the \"magic ring\" was really the [[One Ring]], weapon of [[Sauron]], a thing of evil power thousands of years old. Furthermore, the Dark Lord was now aware of its survival, and would be searching for it, as [[Gollum]] had revealed - under torture - that it was to be found in the Shire. After a long discussion and a test by fire, which revealed the [[Black Speech]] written upon the ring, the two agreed that Frodo would have to leave the Shire for his own safety. [[Samwise Gamgee]], the gardener, was selected to travel with him. Gandalf recommended Rivendell as a destination, as the road was likely safe and the valley well-protected. He told Frodo to take the alias [[Mr. Underhill|Underhill]] while abroad. Frodo was reluctant, but wisely followed the wizard's advice. He bought a house in [[Crickhollow]] as an excuse to head east.\n\nGandalf stayed for two months while Frodo worked out the details. At the end of that time the wizard left to \"get some news\", as rather disturbing tidings had come to his ears. He promised to be back for the farewell party. Meanwhile, Frodo was not aware that some of his closest friends were watching him - [[Fredegar Bolger|Fredegar \"Fatty\" Bolger]], his cousin [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck]], and Sam himself knew that Frodo and Gandalf were in some trouble concerning the Ring, and that Frodo was preparing for some adventure.\n\nAs autumn passed, Frodo was waiting for Gandalf, but did not return and Frodo grew quite anxious. Merry and Fatty drove the cart of Frodo's belongings ahead, while Frodo still waited for Gandalf. At the last possible day, he gave up waiting and departed with Pippin and Sam.\n\n===Hobbiton to Crickhollow===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Last Sight of Hobbiton.jpg|thumb|220px|''Last Sight of Hobbiton'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nLess than a day into their journey, Frodo, strangely nervous, requested that the threesome hide upon the approach of a [[Nazgûl|horseman]]. The rider was dressed in black, riding upon a black horse, and making queer sniffling noises. Frodo felt the urge to put on the Ring and vanish, but just as he was about to give in, the rider departed at a trot. Samwise then remarked upon the \"[[Nazgûl|Black Rider]]\" that had spoken to his father, [[Gaffer Gamgee]], some time earlier. This made Frodo wish that he had waited for Gandalf.\n\nThat night, they were again overtaken by a Black Horseman. This time it seemed to be able to sniff out their hiding place. But as it approached, it was driven away by the song of a group of [[Elves]]. Their leader, [[Gildor]], greeted the hobbits warmly, and lauded Frodo for his knowledge of their tongue. Frodo tried to get information from Gildor on the Black Riders, but the elf would tell him very little. Gildor foresaw that Frodo would have many dealings with the Riders in the future, and urged him to flee them whenever he met them. He and his party left the Hobbits before daybreak, while the three slept.\n\nThe next day the threesome agreed to stay off the road. After a brief scare when Sam sighted a Rider, they worried about losing their way. That evening they heard a terrible wail, and Frodo distinguished words in it. Before long they came to [[Bamfurlong]], the property of [[Farmer Maggot]]. Although Pippin knew Maggot, Frodo recalled a scare he had received at a young age after caught stealing the farmer’s mushrooms, being threatened with the dogs. He froze when the dogs came forth from the house, but Maggot's hospitality soon won him over. When Maggot told of a Black Rider who had stopped at his house asking for \"Baggins,\" and made several shrewd guesses, Frodo grew uncomfortable. Maggot took them to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in his wagon. There they joined up with Merry. As they were ferried across into [[Buckland]], they caught sight of a dark shape on the landing from which they had come.\n\n===Crickhollow to Bree===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight'']]\nWhen they reached the house in Crickhollow, the other hobbits revealed their knowledge of the One Ring and promised to stick with Frodo on the road to [[Rivendell]]. The next morning, leaving Fatty to housesit, they passed into the [[Old Forest]]. In time they were driven by the trees down to the [[Withywindle]], where they were ensnared by [[Old Man Willow]]. Rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], the hobbits came to his house. There they met Tom's wife, [[Goldberry]], and Frodo was moved to poetry over her loveliness. He was interested in Bombadil himself, and several times tried to learn who he was. That night he dreamed of a white-haired figure on a pinnacle of stone, borne away by an eagle.\n\nThe next day Frodo tried on the Ring, after finding it had no effect on Bombadil. Not subject to the Ring’s power, Tom nevertheless could see Frodo. That night Frodo dreamed once more, a dream he never forgot.\n\n{{Blockquote|Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind: a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[Fog on the Barrow-downs]]\"}}\n\nAfter bidding Tom and Goldberry farewell, the Hobbits went on and traveled through the [[barrow-downs]]. Becoming lost in the mist, they were taken by the [[barrow-wights]], Frodo last of all. Frodo woke in the barrow to find the barrow-wight bending over his three friends. He rose and in a tremendous act of bravery and resilience took a sword and smote off the wight's hand. Then he summoned Bombadil with a [[Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!|song]] Tom had taught him. Bombadil drove the wight away and helped Frodo wake the others. Tom gave the hobbits ponies and escorted them all to the road before turning his face back toward the Withywindle. The hobbits continued along the road to Bree, where they took lodging at [[The Prancing Pony]] inn as Bombadil had recommended, with Frodo registering under the name of [[Mr. Underhill|Underhill]] as Gandalf had suggested.\n\n===Strider and Weathertop===\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Strider in The Prancing Pony.jpg|thumb|200px|''Strider in The Prancing Pony'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nWhile Merry went out to take a walk in the night air, the other hobbits came down to the common-room and were introduced by the landlord [[Barliman Butterbur]] to the gathering, Frodo under his alias. Frodo asked if Gandalf was present in Bree, only to learn that he had not yet arrived. While Pippin and Sam enjoyed the drink and conversation, Frodo remained withdrawn, soon falling into conversation with a curious [[Rangers of the North|ranger]] called [[Aragorn|Strider]], who gave him a warning about letting his friends talk to much. Pippin began to tell about [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's Birthday Party]], and Frodo, at Strider’s encouragement and in an attempt to prevent the name of Baggins from being raised, began to sing ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]''. This proved popular with the gathering, but unfortunately, as Frodo relaxed, he fell from the table and the Ring slipped on his finger, causing him to vanish.\n\n[[File:John Howe - Against the Shadow.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Against the Shadow'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nFrodo crawled over to Strider's corner and slipped off the Ring, and said that he had rolled quickly to the side. The suspicious Breelanders, however, grew angry or frightened, and eventually all left the common-room. Frodo and his comrades retired to their room, where they found Strider waiting to talk to them. Strider was honest and blunt, telling what he had overheard and what he knew of them, as well as warning them of the Black Riders and traitors in Bree. He urged them to accept his aide by inviting him into the company. Frodo was leaning to believe the ranger when Butterbur broke in, giving Frodo the long-awaited letter from Gandalf, undelivered by Butterbur’s forgetfulness. After some little bit of light was shed on the situation to the innkeeper, he swore to help the hobbits in any way he could, as a friend of Gandalf and one very much afraid of Mordor. Frodo, reading the letter, learned that Gandalf recommended Strider as one to whom Frodo could go for help. After some further debate, Frodo agreed to let Strider lead them to Rivendell.\n\nStrider arranged for a deception, by moving them to a different room. The next morning, their ponies were gone and the room was ravaged. Butterbur paid for a [[Bill the Pony|replacement pony]], and the four hobbits and ranger set out into the Wilds. They passed through [[Chetwood]] and [[Midgewater Marshes]], and finally to the [[Weather Hills]] before coming up to [[Weathertop]]. Black Riders were sighted from the top of the cairn, and Strider counselled to remain where they were. Shortly after the Black Riders came, and Frodo was stricken down. In desperation he put on the Ring and saw the [[Nazgûl]] in their true forms. Frodo then tried to attack in [[Varda|Elbereth]]’s name, but their leader, the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]], stabbed Frodo in the shoulder with a [[Morgul-knife]], before being driven away by Strider.\n\n===Weathertop to Rivendell===\nBecause of a piece of the knife embedded in his shoulder, Frodo started to become ill, so his companions hurried to take him to the [[Rivendell|House of Elrond]]. After journeying for 12 days, they were found by [[Glorfindel]], one of the [[Calaquendi|High Elves]], who was sent by Elrond to help Frodo after he heard of him from Gildor. Glorfindel, seeing that Frodo was starting to fade, put him upon his horse, [[Asfaloth]], and ordered him to go on when the Ringwraiths approached. Asfaloth outran the steeds of the Nazgûl and bore Frodo across the [[Ford of Bruinen]], but Frodo, who was on the brink of becoming a [[Wraiths|wraith]], turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. The Riders, were driven into the [[Bruinen|River]] by Glorfindel, Strider and the three hobbits, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref> As a sign that Frodo was shifting to the [[Wraith-world]], he could see the [[Unseen]] [[Light of Valinor|luminous form]] of Glorfindel.\n\nUnconscious, Frodo was carried inside Rivendell, where Elrond removed the fragment of the knife from his shoulder. He awoke two days later, mostly recovered, and was delighted to find that Gandalf had arrived.  Frodo's recovery was celebrated with a feast during which he met [[Glóin]] and asked concerning the [[Dwarves of Erebor]]. Afterwards, Elrond led his guests to the [[Hall of Fire]], where Frodo found Bilbo, whom he hadn't seen in seventeen years. Bilbo asked to see the Ring and was saddened to see Frodo's negative reaction.  The two hobbits then enjoyed talking about Bilbo's [[Translations from the Elvish|works on lore]] and [[the Shire]].<ref name=\"Meetings\">{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>\n\n===Fellowship of the Ring===\n{{seealso|Quest of the Ring}}\nDuring the [[Council of Elrond]], it was decided that the Ring must be destroyed by casting it into the [[Cracks of Doom]]. Frodo volunteered to be the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], and a [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] was formed to protect him; the fellowship included Gandalf, Aragorn (Strider's real name), [[Boromir]] of [[Gondor]], [[Legolas]] of the [[Woodland Realm]], [[Gimli]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and Frodo's friends Sam, Merry and Pippin.<ref name=\"council\">{{FR|Council}}</ref> Before their departure, Bilbo gave Frodo his sword, [[Sting]], and his [[Mithril-coat]] to protect him on the perilous journey to [[Mount Doom]] that lay ahead.\n\nOn [[December 25]], the fellowship left Rivendell, and headed south along the west side of the [[Misty Mountains]]. They attempted to cross them by the Redhorn gate, but were thwarted by a fierce blizzard <ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> and had to go back. After surviving a [[Wargs|Warg]] attack, Gandalf persuaded the company to go through the abandoned [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] kingdom of [[Moria]]. Just before entering Moria, Frodo was attacked by the [[Watcher in the Water]] and barely escaped. During the journey through Moria, Frodo began to suspect that something was tracking them. Later, inside the [[chamber of Mazarbul]], the Fellowship was attacked by [[Orcs]], and Frodo was struck by an Orc spear but was saved by the mithril coat he wore. The company escaped the chamber, and were close to exiting Moria, when [[Durin's Bane]] appeared and pursued them to the [[bridge of Khazad-dûm]] where Gandalf held him off so the rest of the Fellowship could escape. After breaking the bridge, both he and the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] fell and disappeared into the chasm below, after which Aragorn took over as leader.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Mirror of Galadriel.jpg|thumb|''The Mirror of Galadriel'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nEventually they reached [[Lothlórien]], and were housed by the elves at [[Caras Galadhon]]. During their rest there, [[Galadriel]] allowed Frodo and Sam to look into the [[Mirror of Galadriel]], in which they saw many things.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> When leaving the Woods, Galadriel gave Frodo a [[Phial of Galadriel|vial]] with light from the [[Silmaril]] of [[Eärendil]].<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>\n\nThey travelled down the [[Anduin]] river in boats given to them by the elves. On their trip down the river, Frodo confirmed his suspicion that they were being trailed by Gollum. At [[Amon Hen]], the Ring's corrupting power caused Boromir to try to take the Ring from Frodo, who escaped by putting it on. Seeing the corrupting influence of the ring on Boromir, he then decided to leave the Fellowship and go on alone, but he was thwarted in this when Sam discovered him attempting to cross the [[Nen Hithoel]], and insisted on accompanying him.\n\n===Emyn Muil to Ithilien=== \nThe two companions reached [[Amon Lhaw]] and toiled through the [[Emyn Muil]]. Soon after, they found Gollum following them, and they captured him with the [[Elven rope]]. \n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Through the Marshes.jpg|thumb|left|''Through the Marshes'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nFrodo decided to trust Gollum to be their guide. He led the Hobbits out of the Emyn Muil and through the [[Dead Marshes]]. During their route, they were delayed several times by a [[Nazgûl]] flying on a [[Fell beasts|fell beast]]. The Hobbits reached [[Carchost]], the western [[Towers of the Teeth|Tower of the Teeth]], where Frodo had intended to enter Mordor, but Gollum persuaded Frodo to follow him to a safer entrance, the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]]. During the next night's march they passed into [[North Ithilien]], and by daylight of [[March 7]] they reached the stream of [[Henneth Annûn]].\n\nTheir camp fire attracted the [[Rangers of Ithilien]], and their leader, [[Faramir]] (Boromir's brother), considered them spies and questioned Frodo concerning their errand, who recounted the journeys of the Fellowship, but said nothing about the Ring. Faramir informed Frodo of Boromir's death, implying Frodo's involvement. Faramir blindfolded the Hobbits and led them to Henneth Annûn, a secret Gondorian outpost, and questioned them further in private. After a meal, Sam accidentally revealed that Frodo had the Ring, but Faramir denied its lure, and thus gained the trust of the hobbits.\n\nDuring the night, Faramir called Frodo and Sam to him, and showed them Gollum, who had found his way to Henneth Annûn, and (ignorant of their presence) was hunting for [[fish]]. Faramir, suspecting that Frodo had lied about Gollum's involvement in their quest, threatened to kill him for fear that he might reveal the location of their outpost to the enemy. Frodo confessed to the part of Gollum in their errand, and begged Faramir not to slay him. Gollum was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Frodo. The following morning Faramir released the three travellers, warning them strongly against taking the pass of Cirith Ungol.\n\n===Entering Mordor===\n[[File:John Howe - Shelob About to Leap on Frodo.jpg|thumb|left|''Shelob About to Leap on Frodo'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nAfter two marches they came to the valley of the [[Morgulduin]] and continued east. On the \"[[Dawnless Day]]\" Gollum lead them east to the [[Southward Road]] and reached the [[Cross-roads]] just as the sun was setting.<ref>{{TT|Journey}}</ref> They reached just opposite the north-facing gate of [[Minas Morgul]] and they saw the Morgul-host march forth.\n\nIn that night they ascended the [[Straight Stair]] and reached the top of the [[Winding Stair]] at dawn of [[March 11]] where they were woken by Gollum. He led the up the to the entrance to [[Shelob's Lair]]. Inside the tunnel Gollum betrayed Frodo and Sam to [[Shelob]] the [[Spiders|spider]], who stung Frodo after he left the tunnel. Sam saved Frodo from being eaten by Shelob, but thought him dead and took the Ring from him, resolving to continue the Quest alone. However Frodo (who was still alive) was captured by Orcs and taken to the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].\n\n===Cirith Ungol to Mount Doom===\n[[File:John Howe - Mount Doom II.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Mount Doom'' by [[John Howe]] ]]\nLearning of this, Sam rescued Frodo and on early [[March 15]] the Hobbits escaped and jumped into the ravine west of the [[Morgai]] and crossed the valley. The next day they attempted to climb the Morgai, but had to retrace their steps and reached the north end of the valley, and on [[March 18]] they  set out on the road that ran to the [[Carach Angren|Isenmouthe]]. There they were overtaken by an Orc troop and had to follow their trot.\n\nAs Sauron's troops moved at night, the hobbits continued their journey in daytime towards Mount Doom. During the morning of [[March 25]] they reached the [[Cracks of Doom|Crack of Doom]] where, at the last moment, Frodo, under the influence of the Ring, claimed it as his own. However, at that moment he was attacked by [[Gollum]], who seized the Ring and then fell into the fire with it, thus destroying the Ring.\n\nBy then, this pressure of the ring reached its maximum, which was impossible, \"especially after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted.\" Frodo had done what he could, and by then he was simply incapable of making a conscious decision to destroy the Ring.<ref>{{L|246}}</ref>\n\n===Return home===\nFrodo and Sam were rescued by [[Gwaihir]], [[Landroval]] and [[Meneldor]] and taken to [[Ithilien]]. After being healed and having rested for a month, the Ring-bearers were honoured on the [[Field of Cormallen]]. The following months the Hobbits witnessed the coronation of their companion Aragorn as King Elessar, and were present at his marriage to [[Arwen]] that summer. Arwen renounced her [[immortality]] and gave to Frodo her place to sail into the [[Uttermost West|West]]. She also gave to Frodo a white gem on a silver necklace that she claims would aid him when he remembers the fear and darkness of the toll the ring took on him.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\nFrodo and his company left Minas Tirith on [[July 19]] for [[Edoras]] and the funeral of King [[Théoden]], then set out for the [[Hornburg]] and eventually [[Isengard]]. They parted there from Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn.\n\nAfter overtaking Saruman and [[Gríma|Wormtongue]], they reached the [[Mountains of Moria]]; and when they approached [[Lothlórien]], [[Celeborn]] and Galadriel parted from their company. The hobbits, with Gandalf and other Elves, reached Rivendell on [[September 21]], where Frodo met Bilbo once again.\n\nThey stayed there until [[October 5]] and eventually visited the ''Prancing Pony'' in Bree before reaching the Shire. At the Buckland Gate Gandalf left them to go and have a talk with Tom Bombadil. Once in the Shire, they reached [[Frogmorton]] where they were arrested. The next day they reached [[Bywater]] where they defeated the [[ruffians]] who had overtaken their land. The leader of the ruffians was revealed to be Saruman, and Frodo decided to let him live, even after he had tried to stab him with a knife. But Saruman did not live much longer, for his servant, Wormtongue, killed him himself (before being killed by the hobbits), thus ending the [[War of the Ring]].\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Francesco Amadio - Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|220px|''Grey Havens'' by [[:Category:Images by Francesco Amadio|Francesco Amadio]]]]\nOver the next two years, the travellers reordered the Shire and their lives; but Frodo was still troubled by his wounds, falling ill every [[13 March]] and [[6 October]], clutching the white gem in a manner reminiscent of the One Ring. Frodo served as [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] until [[Will Whitfoot]] was restored in {{SR|1420}}.<ref name=\"chief\">{{App|Chief}}</ref> Having no family of his own, Frodo left his estate ([[Bag End]]) and passed on the [[Red Book of Westmarch|Red Book]] to Samwise Gamgee, who named [[Frodo Gardner|his son]] after Frodo.\n\nOn [[September 21]] of {{TA|3021}} Frodo set out for the [[Grey Havens]]. Going south to Woody End he met the [[Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings]], Elrond, Galadriel, and Bilbo. On [[September 29]] they came to the firth of [[Lhûn]] where Gandalf awaited them, and on the [[White Ship]]<ref name=\"chief\" /> they crossed the [[Straight Road]] into the West. Frodo would spend the rest of his days in \"a period of reflection and peace\" on [[Tol Eressëa]], giving him the opportunity to truly understand his position in [[Arda]] before passing beyond the [[Circles of the World]].<ref>{{L|246}}: \"a gaining of a truer understanding of his position...\"</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAccording to [[Elanor Gardner]], Sam followed Frodo across the sea on September 22, 1482 following the death of his wife [[Rose Cotton|Rose (née Cotton)]].<ref>{{App|B5}}: \"''Among them the tradition is handed down from Elanor...''\"</ref>\n\nAt some point well into the [[Fourth Age]], the words \"''Frodos Dreme''\" appeared scrawled at the head of a poem, [[The Sea-Bell]], within the Red Book, possibly derived from the nightmares that Frodo had before passing into the West.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}: \"''It is the latest piece and belongs to the Fourth Age...''\"</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe only real description of Frodo's appearance was given only once by Gandalf in his letter to Barliman Butterbur, in which he was declared a \"stout fellow with red cheeks, taller than some (hobbits), and fairer than most\", with a cleft chin, a bright eye, and a perky personality.<ref name=\"Strider\" /> Although Frodo was apparently fairly stout before his journey, he seemed to have lost a significant amount of weight on his trip from Hobbiton to Rivendell.<ref name=\"Meetings\" />  Also, at a later point, Sam remarked that Frodo was \"too thin and drawn\" for a hobbit.<ref>{{TT|Herbs}}</ref>\n\nFrodo carried a small Elven sword called [[Sting]] and wore a coat of Dwarven mail made of ''[[mithril]]'' under his clothes, both given to him by Bilbo. In [[Lothlórien]], [[Galadriel]] gave him an [[Elven cloaks|Elven cloak]] that helped him blend in with his natural surroundings and a phial carrying the light of the [[Star of Eärendil]] to aid him on his quest.\n\nBefore Frodo returned to the Shire after the Quest of the Ring was completed, Arwen Evenstar, wife of Aragorn and daughter of Elrond, gave Frodo a white gem on a silver necklace to wear around his neck.\n\nFrodo is said to have shown great \"skill with foreign sounds\" and probably could pronounce [[Elvish]] correctly, more than other Hobbits (who pronounced long Elvish vowels as diphthongs).<ref>{{App|Vowels}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Frodo Baggins'' is an English translation of his [[Westron]] name '''[[Maura]] [[Baggins Family|Labingi]]'''. The name ''Maura'' has the element ''maur-'' (wise, experienced), which Tolkien equated to the Germanic element ''frod-'' of the same meaning. Frodo's name in [[Sindarin]] was '''''[[Iorhael]]''''' (\"old-wise\") although in some instance he is mentioned as '''Daur''' (probably [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''[[taur]]'').\n\n''Frodo'' is a real name, which comes from the Gemranic tradition with ''Fróda'' being its [[Old English]] form. It is obviously connected with the Old English word ''fród'', which means \"wise by experience\", but it was connected mythologically with legends of the Golden Age in the North.<ref>{{L|168}}</ref>\n\nIn the German translation he is called ''Frodo Beutlin'', in Spanish, ''Frodo Bolsón'', in French, ''Frodon Sacquet'', or ''Frodo Bessac'' (in the latest translation of the books), in Norwegian, ''Frodo Lommelun'', in Danish, ''Frodo Sækker'', in Faroese, ''Fróði Pjøkin'', in Finnish, ''Frodo Reppuli'', in Swedish, ''Frodo Secker'', in Portuguese, ''Frodo Bolseiro'', in Czech, ''Frodo Pytlík,'' and in Dutch, ''Frodo Balings''. In one of three Polish translations he is called ''Frodo Bagosz'', but he keeps his original name in the other two.\n\n===Other names===\n*Frodo Baggins - ''fród'' means \"wise by experience\" in [[Old English]]. Baggins may have been a reference to [[Bag End]] or may come from \"bagging\" which means \"eating between meals\" in northern England.\n*[[Maura]] [[Baggins Family|Labingi]] - the [[Hobbitish]] name for Frodo.\n*[[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] - he bore the [[One Ring]] to [[Mount Doom]].\n*[[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]] - given to him by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]].\n*[[Mr. Underhill]] - used during his stay in [[The Prancing Pony]] to conceal his identity.\n*The Halfling - a name used for him from [[Boromir]]'s dream.

His grandfather [[Oropher]] was of the [[Sindar]] of [[Doriath]], and his father [[Thranduil]] was king of Mirkwood ([[Greenwood the Great]]). His birthdate is unknown, as are his earliest exploits. His most notable role is the part he played in the [[War of the Ring]], during which he represented the [[Elves|Elven]] in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. His Elven abilities, such as superior sight and hearing, lightness of foot, and skilled archery, were invaluable to his eight companions.\n\nLegolas' unlikely friendship with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], [[Gimli]] son of [[Glóin]] was considered odd. As such a friendship was rare between the two races, due to the long-standing grievances between [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] dating back to the [[Elder Days]]. And, unlikely because of the grudge between their two particular houses for the rough treatment Glóin and the rest of [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s company was given by Thranduil on an earlier occasion.<ref>{{H|8}}; {{H|9}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nThere are nothing to say about Legolas’s birthdate and early upbringing, except for the very few things he himself has said on the matter.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], the creature [[Gollum]] was captured by [[Aragorn]], and put under lock and key by the [[Elves of Mirkwood]]. Through their over-kindliness to him, however, Gollum managed an escape with the help of [[Sauron]]'s [[Orcs]]. Legolas was dispatched to [[Rivendell]] to deliver this ill news to [[Elrond]] and [[Gandalf]].<ref name=\"Council\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nLegolas was present at the [[Council of Elrond]] and related the news of Gollum's escape, quickly adding that it was not through lack of vigilance that he slipped their grasp, and provided a detailed account of the whole affair to the Council.<ref name=\"Council\" /> He spoke little if at all after his report, but was later chosen to represent the Elves in the [[Nine Walkers]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] to participate in the [[Quest of the Ring]]. His skills would prove invaluable to the Fellowship. \n\n===Fellowship of the Ring===\nFor the early part of the quest, the nine companions walked single file, Gandalf leading, Legolas, with his keen eyes, providing the rearguard.  When the Company came to [[Hollin]], Legolas was very deeply moved: the wholesome air yet spoke of the Elves that dwelt there long ago, and his sharp ears heard the very stones crying out for grief at their departure and memory of their ways.<ref name=\"South\" />  \n\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - 'I go to find the Sun!'.jpg|thumb|''I go to find the Sun!'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nAs they ascended [[Caradhras]], Legolas in his light shoes could walk on top of the snow, whereas the others were forced to trudge and wade their way forward. But snow or no snow, nothing could dampen his buoyant Elven spirit, and he joked lightly with Gandalf even at the darkest moments. He scouted ahead and behind the company, dancing over the snow with great ease, and brought news that the storm was, as they had been fearing, put out to stop them by some Power greater than they. When this report arrived, Gandalf reluctantly decided to abandon the idea of crossing by the [[Redhorn Gate]]. Legolas stayed near the [[Hobbits]] on the dangerous descent.<ref name=\"South\">{{FR|South}}</ref>\n\nAt the bottom of the mountain, the company took a vote on attempting passage through [[Moria]]. Legolas was silent until asked for his opinion, and then said simply and seemingly reluctantly, \"I do not wish to go to Moria.\" His loyalty and respectful deference to the decisions of the two leaders, Aragorn and Gandalf, extended even to following them through darkness and unknown horror; of all the Company, he was arguably the most loyal to leadership. When the voices of the [[Wargs]] were heard and the attack began, Legolas did perhaps more than anyone save Gandalf, shooting numerous Wargs and even collecting his spent arrows to fire again, retrieving them, like a responsible bowman, after the fight ended.<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref>\n\nThe Fellowship reached the West Gate of Moria, and were halted by the doors fast shut. At last gaining entrance, the Company, following Gandalf's staff, began their march through Moria, a pit so profoundly dark that even Legolas' eyes could see nothing. He served his turn, like the others, in lookout duty through the night on the march. When they came to the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] and were attacked by the Orcs, Legolas dispatched at least two before following the others out the east door, having to drag Gimli away from [[Balin]]'s tomb. When [[Durin's Bane]] made its frightful appearance, Legolas was the first to spot it when he turned to shoot an arrow towards the Orcs. He recognized it immediately as a [[Balrog]], and it is the only recorded time he was ever truly afraid: a Balrog held far more terror for an Elf than for any other, for only they remembered where the Demons of Fire had come from and whom they had first served.<ref name=\"Bridge\">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Crossing Nimrodel.jpg|thumb|''Crossing Nimrodel'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nAfter the fall of Gandalf, Aragorn led the Fellowship eastwards to the borders of the forest of Lórien. Legolas was seized with a deep excitement, for none of his kindred had been into the wood for many years, and he himself had only heard of it from tales. He was grieved, though, that it was winter, and the full glory of the ''[[Mellyrn]]'' was departed. The Fellowship splashed across the [[Nimrodel]] river, feeling their weariness drained away by its cool waters. As they rested on the shore, Legolas told the tales of [[Lothlórien]] still remembered by the Mirkwood Elves and sang to them part of the [[Lay of Nimrodel]]. At last, the Company turned aside from the path in order to shelter in the trees for the night, not caring to be caught on the ground by the Orcs pursuing them from Moria. Upon being surprised and questioned by the Elves of Lórien who were watching from a tree, Legolas responded cautiously in their own tongue. When [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] queried as to what they were saying, Legolas slyly responded, \"They say that you breathe so loud they could shoot you in the dark.\" He hastened to add that they need not fear the Elves.\n\nLegolas was called up to meet with the [[Galadhrim]], bringing Frodo, though Sam followed, as always. The Galadhrim had heard Legolas' singing and knew him for one of their northern kindred. They had had tidings from the sons of Elrond as to the Quest upon which the Company was embarked, and readily accepted all of the fellowship save Gimli, who was only grudgingly allowed, for the suspicion of the Elves of Lórien towards the Dwarves was especially acute. Legolas was forced to answer for the company, with the reminder to keep an eye on \"that dwarf\". The next morning, when the Elves took the company across the river [[Celebrant]] on their way to [[Caras Galadhon]], they told Gimli he would have to be blindfolded, but he was outraged and refused. When Aragorn offered for all of the Company to wear blindfolds, Gimli said if only Legolas would wear one, he would. Legolas was outraged in turn, but Aragorn settled the dispute by asking to blindfold the whole of the Company. In the end, Legolas had no choice but to agree.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Michael Kaluta - Legolas Draws the Bow of Galadriel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Legolas Draws the Bow of Galadriel'' by [[Michael Kaluta]]]]\nIn Lothlórien, many Elves sang of Gandalf, and their language was such that only Legolas could understand. Legolas would not translate the lamentations for the rest of the Company, saying that he had neither the skill nor the heart. During their time in Lórien, however, with the influence of the Lady [[Galadriel]] permeating the air, he became fast friends with Gimli, a friendship that would never be broken.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> He was one of the Company that could handle boats, and when the Fellowship prepared to leave Lórien, he was assigned to paddle one with Gimli. From the lady Galadriel, he received an Elven cloak and brooch, like the others, and a long, stout bow and quiver of arrows, such as the Galadhrim used.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Company was ambushed by orc-archers on the [[Anduin]], Legolas quickly leaped out onto dry ground and up the riverbank with his bow, searching in the darkness for any sign of the Orcs. From Frodo's low position in the boats, he appeared to be crowned with white stars as he stood tall upon the bank. Suddenly, the south wind chased the clouds away, and a chilling dread fell on the Company. Legolas looked up, and sighed, \"[[Elbereth Gilthoniel]]!\" as if to draw strength to face the terror riding high in the wind. As the Shadow approached, he bent the great bow of Lórien and shot the descending [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]] from the sky, one of his most masterful deeds. He was praised by the rest of the Company for this, especially Gimli.<ref>{{FR|River}}</ref>\n\n===Three Hunters===\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Awaiting the Riders of Rohan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Awaiting the Riders of Rohan'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nWhen the company was ambushed on [[Amon Hen]], Legolas shot many Orcs until his arrows ran out, and then used his knife.<ref>{{FR|Breaking}}</ref> Upon the [[breaking of the Fellowship]], when he learned that Boromir had fallen, he sang a lament with Aragorn, taking the part of the South Wind, which came from the Sea.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}</ref> Legolas was of great aid to Aragorn in the days following, as he helped to track the [[Uruk-hai]] across [[Rohan]]. His eyes could see many leagues, and for a while he could see their quarry far ahead of them.<ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref>\n\nWhen accosted by the [[Riders of Rohan]] led by [[Éomer]], Legolas stood by his friend Gimli when confronted by the haughty Marchwarden, threatening him with death if he attempted to harm the dwarf. When Éomer lent them horses to speed them on their way, Legolas was given [[Arod]], a very high-spirited horse. But Legolas had the Elvish way with beasts, and after he had leaped lightly upon Arod, the horse was docile beneath him. Legolas let Gimli ride behind him on the way to [[Fangorn Forest]] in their search for [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. When they arrived by the smoking pile of Orc ashes, they combed the battlefield for any sign of the Hobbits for several hours, but gave up as night approached. Camping under the eaves of the forest, Legolas noticed how the tree beneath which they sat seemed glad of the fire they lit, stretching out its limbs and leaves to the heat. Though the night was very dark, he was also the first to notice the absence of the horses. Later he asserted to Aragorn that the beasts sounded joyful, confirming Aragorn’s own guess.<ref name=\"White\">{{TT|White}}</ref>\n\nUpon entering Fangorn, Legolas declared that he almost felt young again beside those trees. He commented that in earlier days he could have been happy there. Gimli snorted, saying, “''I dare say you could. You are a Wood-elf, anyway, though Elves of any kind are strange folk.''” Legolas would later reverse this declaration at the [[Hornburg]]. When the [[Three Hunters]] met with the apparition of an old man, whom they believed to be [[Saruman]], despite Gimli’s encouragement Legolas did not shoot him. The old man declared, \"''Put away that bow, Master Elf.''\" Legolas dropped his bow, but later picked it up again, and was about to shoot when it was seen that beneath the old man’s robes there was white. Yet he recognised that it was [[Gandalf]] just in time, and shot his arrow high in the air to be consumed by fire. Gandalf coolly added, \"''Well met, I say to you again, Legolas!''\"<ref name=\"White\" />\n\n===With the Rohirrim===\nLegolas was the first to ask Gandalf about Merry and Pippin, and Gandalf’s apparently miraculous escape. After the story, Gandalf delivered [[Galadriel's messages]] to each of them, Legolas' being:\n\n{{blockquote|Legolas Greenleaf long under tree<br />\nIn joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea!<br />\nIf thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,<br />\nThy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.<ref name=White/>}}\n\nLater, Legolas again used his eyes for the help of the company, as he spied both of [[Isengard]] and [[Edoras]] from afar. He played only a passive role in the healing of [[Théoden|Théoden King]], and later was arrayed in shining mail beside Aragorn. Gimli would not ride on Éomer's horse unless Legolas rode beside them, which he did gladly. Éomer declared, \"''Legolas upon my left, and Aragorn upon my right, and none will dare to stand before us!''\"<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:John Howe - Legolas and Gimli at Helm's Deep.jpg|thumb|right|''Legolas and Gimli at Helm's Deep'' [[John Howe]]]]\nAs Legolas stood at the [[Hornburg]] at the eve of battle, he said that he did not like the place. Gimli comforted him, and he was glad that the dwarf stood by his side. He also wished that a hundred archers of [[Mirkwood]] were there, noting the small number of bowmen among the [[Rohirrim]]. At the opening of the battle, Legolas shot twenty at least, this figure being taken as precise by Gimli. When Gimli returned to the elf for the second time to declare that he slew twenty-one, Legolas counted his kills as twenty-four. By the time the [[Fire of Orthanc]] blew out a piece of the wall, his quiver was nearly empty. With the last arrow the elf saved Aragorn’s life when he stumbled while pursued. At the end of the battle, Legolas had shot a total of forty-one, though Gimli surpassed his count by one.<ref name=\"Road\">{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\nLegolas showed great interest in the [[Huorns]] on the way to [[Isengard]], discussing them with Gandalf and a less willing Gimli. Legolas promised Gimli that he would go to [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]] after the war upon hearing the dwarf’s eloquence, if only Gimli would accompany him on a return to Fangorn. At Isengard he enjoyed a meal in the company of Gimli, Aragorn, and the [[Hobbits]], Merry and Pippin.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}</ref>\n\n===Return of the King===\nWhen Aragorn made clear his purpose as to the taking of the [[Paths of the Dead]], Legolas and Gimli willingly volunteered to go with him. Legolas predicted, when Gimli suggested that Galadriel might have sent them soldiers from their own lands, that they need not ride away to find war.\n\nAmidst the Paths of the Dead, riding with the [[Grey Company]], Legolas alone, save for [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], [[Elrond|Elrond's]] sons, felt no fear of the [[Oathbreakers]],<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref> and it may be remembered that the High Elves had power both in the worlds of the seen and unseen. Yet his turn came to be struck to the heart in the opposite sense – when he heard the gulls at [[Pelargir]], fulfilling Galadriel’s prediction and warning. While telling this story later, he stopped there, while Gimli promptly said, \"''For my part I heeded them not''\". Legolas saw as Aragorn led the Dead Men what a mighty lord he might have been if he had taken the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"Debate\">{{RK|Debate}}</ref>\n\nLegolas came with Aragorn from the ships during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]], and fought there beside his comrades. He survived the battle, and afterward commented on the longevity and eventual domination of [[Men]] to the dubious Gimli.<ref name=\"Debate\" />\n\n===Battle of the Morannon and aftermath===\nLegolas rode for the last time into battle beside his friends to the [[Battle of the Morannon]]. He witnessed the Fall of the Dark Tower, and after the battle attended the ceremonies of the [[Field of Cormallen]] in honour of Frodo and Samwise and their victory. That night Legolas would not go to bed, but instead went away to walk in the woods, singing of the Sea.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>\n\nAt the urging of Aragorn, Legolas remained in [[Minas Tirith]] for a time, after attending the coronation of [[Aragorn|Elessar]]. During the parting of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]], Legolas went with Gimli to [[Aglarond]]. After that, he rode off with Gimli to return to [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\n===After the War of the Ring===\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Legolas and Gimli depart.jpg|thumb|''Legolas and Gimli depart'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]] \nIn the early Fourth Age Legolas brought south [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves out of Greenwood]], and they dwelt in Ithilien, which became once again the fairest country in all the westlands.<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>{{rp|1080}} During his stay in Ithilien, Legolas devised the renowned gardens of Prince Faramir's new home in the Hills of [[Emyn Arnen]].<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Commentary on ''The Stewards of Gondor'' (\"Faramir\"), p. 220</ref>\n\nLegolas and the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-Elves]] later worked together with Gimli and the Dwarves to rebuild and improve [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\"Durin\" />{{rp|1080}} After King Elessar died in {{FoA|120}}, Legolas built a grey ship in Ithilien and sailed down the Anduin and onwards into the [[Aman|West]],<ref name=\"AppB\">{{App|Later}}, entry '''1541''', p. 1098</ref> reportedly taking Gimli with him.<ref name=\"Durin\" />{{rp|1081}}<ref name=\"AppB\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Appearance and equipment===\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] recounts that his father wrote the following \"wrathful\" comment protesting against a \"pretty\" or \"ladylike\" depiction of Legolas: \n{{blockquote|He was tall as a young tree, lithe, immensely strong, able swiftly to draw a great war-bow and shoot down a Nazgûl, endowed with the tremendous vitality of Elvish bodies, so hard and resistant to hurt that he went only in light shoes over rock or through snow, the most tireless of all the Fellowship.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', p. 327}}\n\nAt Rivendell, Legolas was dressed in green and brown garb,<ref name=\"Council\" /> and he was probably dressed similarly for the duration of the quest.\nHe bore a bow from Mirkwood, and later a [[Bow of the Galadhrim]]. He also had a long white knife.<ref name=\"South\" /> He was a master archer, unmatched by any other during his time, capable of shooting adversaries from afar, and on occasion kill more than one with a single arrow, as shown when he nailed two orcs through the throat in Moria.<ref name=\"Bridge\" /> His skill with a bow was even more formidable due to his keen eyesight. At the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], he also proved skilled at knife-fighting in close quarters.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref>\n\n===Personality===\nLegolas showed almost irrepressible cheerfulness throughout the journey, passing through Caradhras and even the Paths of the Dead without hesitation or complaint. His youthful nature can be seen from the mocking way he spoke of the \"strong men\" on Caradhras, who Boromir (meaning himself and Aragorn) had said could forge a way out through the snow.<ref name=\"South\" /> He is perhaps most remembered for his friendship with Gimli the Dwarf, and it was during this friendship that we see his faithfulness, and also his love of beauty. Gimli's words moved him when the dwarf spoke of the [[Glittering Caves]].<ref name=\"Road\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Legolas'' is a [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan]] dialect form of pure [[Sindarin]] ''Laegolas'', which means \"Greenleaf\". At one point he is called \"Legolas '''Greenleaf'''\" by Gandalf, coupling his name and its translation like an epithet.<ref group=\"note\">''Greenleaf'' is not his surname, as is sometimes erroneously believed; nor is it an epithet (like ''[[Oakenshield]]'').</ref> \n\n''Legolas'' consists of the [[Sindarin]] words ''laeg'', a very rare, archaic word for \"green\" (cf. ''Laegrim, Laegel(d)rim'', the [[Green Elves]]), which is normally replaced by ''calen'' (cf. ''[[Calenhad]], [[Parth Galen]]'' and ''[[Pinnath Gelin]]''); and ''golas'', a collection of leaves, foliage (being a prefixed collective form of ''[[lass|las(s)]]'', \"leaf\").<ref>{{L|211}}</ref><ref name=\"pe17\">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|84}}\n\nIn one note, [[Tolkien]] considered ''Legolas'' to be a non-Sindarin name, instead being [[Ossiriand]]ish in which ''laiquā'' > ''lēgo'' (shortened in trisyllabic names to ''lěgo'').<ref name=\"pe17\" />{{rp|153}}\n\nThe [[Quenya]] cognate of ''Laegolas'' was '''''Laicolasse'''''.<ref name=\"pe17\" />{{rp|56}}\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| ORO |ORO=[[Oropher]]<br/><small>''d. {{SA|3434}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| |}}\n{{familytree| THR |THR=[[Thranduil]]<br/><small>''Unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| |}}\n{{familytree| LEG |LEG='''LEGOLAS'''<br/><small>''Sailed West {{FoA|120}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe name \"''[[Legolas (elf of Gondolin)|Legolas Greenleaf]]''\" appeared first in \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\" in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', applied to a character who guided some survivors of the sack of the city to safety.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, ''Entries in the Name-list to The Fall of Gondolin'', p. 217</ref> However, this character had no further development in the [[Legendarium]] and is unrelated to the Legolas of the Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nWhile writing ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien first considered [[Glorfindel]] to be the Elven character of the Fellowship, however he dropped the idea, and Legolas was created to replace him. Perhaps this is the reason why Legolas is considered the most underdeveloped character of the Fellowship, playing only a minor role in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com/post/53965333513/why-is-legolass-character-so-underdeveloped|articlename=Why is Legolas so underdeveloped?|website=[http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com Ask About Middle-Earth]}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n<gallery class=center mode=nolines widths=300 heights=200>\nFile:Sagan om Ringen - Legolas.png|''[[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|Sagan om Ringen]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Legolas 2.jpg|[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Legolas at Amon Hen.jpg|[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Legolas.JPG|[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings- The Treason of Isengard - Legolas.png|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Treason of Isengard]]''\nFile:Lego Legolas poster.png|Legolas as a ''[[Lego]] mini figure''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Legolas.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:[[Frank Duncan]] was the voice of Legolas.\n\n'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''\n:Legolas is chosen as the elf representative of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].

This would make him 2931 years old at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. This date for Legolas' birth was made up by the movie writers. Curiously, the year 2931 was the year Aragorn was born; the writers may have picked the number at random from the ''Tale of Years'' in the [[Appendix B|Appendices]].\n\n:He is presented as an unstoppable fighter, arguably to the point of stealing the show; he performs show-stopping yet implausible stunts in battle scenes. For example, in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], he slides down a staircase using a shield, shooting arrows all the while, and in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], he takes down an [[Oliphaunts|Oliphaunt]] all by himself. However, in the books, Legolas's exploits in battle are not presented in great detail. Aside from shooting the fell beast, he undertakes no major actions other than to make peace with Gimli, overcoming their longstanding mutual racial animosity — he and Gimli are followers, rather than leaders. The film-makers later stated that the entire scene of Legolas killing the Oliphaunt and its entire crew was filmed during pick-ups (months after original filming) to insert a major action scene showcasing him, because at that point they realized that he simply doesn't get to do much in the third part of the trilogy.\n\n:Legolas bears two long knives, while in the book he bears only one. Another, more trivial change, was the number of Orcs he and Gimli kill at [[Helm's Deep]]: 42 and 43, respectively. It is not clear whether this was an intentional change on the part of the filmmakers, though it seems likely that it was, since the original numbers were so clear in Tolkien's own text.\n\n:Playing Legolas in the trilogy was Orlando Bloom's breakout route to superstardom. His handsome features and Legolas's \"coolness\", so to speak, as depicted in the film, have led to the character becoming an unprecedented fan favourite with both fangirls and fanboys, not to mention other Tolkien fans. Many debaters on the Internet during earlier stages of production were worried that a film portrayal of Legolas might render him as far too effeminate for popular consumption. Later, many felt that Bloom was able to avoid this entirely.\n\n'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Legolas is provided by Richard Stanke.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Legolas is a non-playable character, accompanying the Ring-bearer since Rivendell.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Legolas is one of the three playable characters.\n\n'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Legolas is a playable character, skilled in both ranged and melee.

However he joins her in pursuit of the pack of Orcs (led by [[Bolg]]) who are after [[Thorin]]. Thranduil and Legolas later interrogate [[Narzug]], a captured Orc. Alarmed by the news, Thranduil orders his Realm to be sealed from the outside world, but when Legolas hears that Tauriel has run after Kili, he leaves to find her.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:Legolas appears after the destruction of [[Lake-town]]. With Tauriel he goes to investigate the Orcs' armies in [[Gundabad]] where his mother was killed during an old battle, something about which his father never talks. He returns to the ruins of [[Dale]] where the [[Lake-men]] are regrouping. He participates in the [[Battle of Five Armies]] and goes with Tauriel to the [[Ravenhill]] to support [[Thorin]]. In order to save Tauriel from Bolg, he uses a mutilated [[Trolls|Troll]] to demolish an ancient tower and duels with Bolg. Bitter with his father's treatment towards Tauriel, he says that he won't return to Mirkwood; Thranduil advises him to go to [[Eriador|the North]] and find the [[Rangers of the North|Dúnedain]] and a young ranger called \"[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]].\" Before parting, Thranduil assures him that his mother loved him more than anything else.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Legolas/Disputes]]\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{councilofelrond}}{{fellowship}}{{FellowshipRoute}}\n{{hobbitfilms}}{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Fourth Age characters]]\n[[Category:Mariners]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Silvan Elvish names]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Legolas (Thranduils Sohn)]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/teleri/standard/legolas]]\n[[fi:Legolas]]",

His father was [[Glóin]], a direct descendant of [[King of Durin's Folk|King]] [[Náin II]] and, through him, of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].<ref name=appdurin>{{App|Durin}}</ref> His father joined [[Thorin and Company]] in their [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] to reclaim the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]], but Gimli was forbidden because he was too young: only 62 at the time.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves were successful in their Quest and Gimli and his father were among the Dwarves who returned to Erebor. Years later, in {{TA|3017}}, Gimli witnessed the arrival of a messenger of [[Sauron]] (possibly a [[Nazgûl]]) inquiring about [[Bilbo Baggins]], old acquaintance of his father, and the [[One Ring|Ring of Power]], promising tempting offers. Gimli accompanied his troubled father to [[Rivendell]] for the dual purpose of warning Bilbo and seeking the counsel of [[Elrond]] on such weighty matters. He attended the [[Council of Elrond]] as a representative of the [[Dwarves of Erebor]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\n===The Fellowship of the Ring===\nGimli, as the only young dwarf seen at the council of Elrond, was appointed as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He alone of the company wore a mail-shirt, and carried a broad-bladed axe. He quickly distinguished himself in the company by declaring that he \"[needed] no map\" and naming the [[Misty Mountains]] individually by their [[Khuzdul]] names, inspiring the comment from [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]: \"A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!\"<ref name=\"South\">{{FR|South}}</ref>\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Balin's Tomb.jpg|left|thumb|''Balin's Tomb'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nGimli stood more than all the others with [[Gandalf]] on the matter of passing through [[Moria]]. This may be influenced by his curiosity about the fate of his cousin [[Balin]], who went thither to [[Balin's folk|refound]] the ancient kingdom of the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]], and also his vengeful nature. His first clash with [[Legolas]] occurred before the [[Doors of Durin]], in a brief dispute over whose fault it was (the Elves’ or the Dwarves’) that the friendship between the two races waned.<ref name=\"Journey\">{{FR|Journey}}</ref> Gandalf quickly intervened, though it was not until [[Lothlórien]] that they would truly become friends.\n\nHe was quite helpful to Gandalf in explaining the Doors to the other curious members of the fellowship. Gandalf showed his appreciation of Gimli’s skills by letting him walk up front through the dark tunnels beside himself, and taking brief counsels with him when the way was unsure. It is probable that here Gandalf was tapping into Dwarven inborn or developed skills rather than actual knowledge of Moria itself, as Gimli had never personally been there.\n\nGimli reacted most indignantly to Sam’s suggestion that Moria was but \"holes\", going so far as to chant for him an ancient [[The world was young, the mountains green,|song]]. Gimli continued to be helpful to Gandalf on the rest of the dark passage, and boldly aided in the [[Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul]], protecting Balin’s tomb. After Gandalf remained behind to halt the Balrog, Gimli led the others across the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]].\n\nHe again showed great emotion when they neared [[Kheled-zâram]], taking [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] alone out of all the company with him to see it (though Sam followed as well).<ref name=\"Lorien\">{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> This hinted at a degree of affection for Frodo, though it may merely have been because he was the most important of the company. Despite his helpfulness, at [[Lothlórien]] he became the greatest hindrance to the Company, when he alone was required to be blindfolded and of all of them liked the idea the least (save for perhaps Legolas). The compromise was made that the entire company would go through the Golden Wood in this manner, that Gimli would not suffer alone.<ref name=\"Lorien\" />\n\nDespite this early struggle, it was Gimli of all the company that was most remembered for his deeds in Lothlórien. For his heart softened towards [[Galadriel]] and as a result toward Elves in general when that great lady sympathised with his sorrows, using the traditional Khuzdul names.<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> In return he attempted to compliment her, as he saw her love and understanding. Though slightly clumsy in his first attempt, he distinguished himself when, as Galadriel gave the Company [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]], he asked only for a single strand of her hair. Galadriel gave him three hairs with a blessing, probably remembering when [[Fëanor]] had requested a similar gift several millennia ago. She later referred to him as \"[[Lockbearer]]\". Gimli wept openly at the departure from Lothlórien, calling the light more dangerous than the darkness he had feared.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the Fellowship departed from Lothlórien, Gimli had become fast friends with Legolas the Elf, a result of Galadriel’s kindness. This, too, made him famous among all the Dwarves of the [[Third Age]].\n\n===The Three Hunters===\n{{Main|Three Hunters}}\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Pursuit in Rohan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Pursuit in Rohan'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nAfter the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], during which he and Legolas slew many [[orcs]], Gimli listened in silence as his only remaining comrades, [[Aragorn]] and Legolas, sang a [[Song of Boromir|lament]] for Boromir in the character of three of the Winds. Only the East Wind was left, and Gimli would not sing it, which Aragorn declared to be appropriate.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}</ref>\n\nFor most of the chase he served as a commentator, usually leaving the decisions to Aragorn. His reaction was quite hostile to the suspicious [[Rohirrim]], especially after [[Éomer]]'s rash comments about Galadriel. Little did either know that they would become close friends in the times to come as fiery words passed between them. After the [[Three Hunters]] were lent horses, Gimli and Éomer parted in peace, with promises to one another of reconciliation.\n\nOf the Three Hunters, Gimli seemed the most shaken by [[Fangorn Forest]] while they searched for traces of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Gimli felt no reluctance to shoot the “unarmed” old man whom they thought was [[Saruman]], unlike Aragorn and Legolas. After Gandalf was revealed to them, Gimli fell to his knees. Gandalf put his hand on Gimli’s head, and the dwarf laughed for the first time recorded during the [[Quest of the Ring]].\n\nGimli was delighted by the [[White Mountains]] and [[Helm's Deep]], declaring \"This country has tough bones\". He declared that if he had a hundred of his kin he could make the fortress invincible.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}, p. 532</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - The Glittering Caves of Aglarond.jpg|thumb|left|''The Glittering Caves of Aglarond'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nDuring the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Gimli saved Éomer’s life outside the gates. He came in, boasting of his first two orc-kills to his friend Legolas. Legolas estimated his slaughter to amount to twenty, starting the good-hearted orc-killing game that continued through the rest of the battle. Gimli was among the first to the culvert when the orcs crept through, leaping heroically into their midst from the walls. He then proceeded to lead the blocking up of the culvert.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref> During the course of the battle, Gimli was one of those forced into the [[Glittering Caves]]. He was astonished to see the magnificence of these caverns, moving even Legolas with his glowing description of them.<ref>{{TT|Road}}, pp. 547-8</ref> This one sight would change his life.\n\nHis final kill score number was forty-two in that battle, surpassing his friend the elf by one.<ref>{{TT|Road}}, p. 543</ref> Gimli shows a hint of humour and affection when he greets the two [[Hobbits]] Merry and Pippin comfortably situated among [[wikipedia:flotsam|flotsam]] and [[wikipedia:jetsam|jetsam]] in the ruin of [[Isengard]].<ref>{{TT|Road}}, p. 557</ref> He declared himself deep in Pippin’s debt when the hobbit lent him his spare pipe.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 563</ref>\n\nGimli shows some of the stone hardness of Dwarves when they meet [[Saruman]] at [[Orthanc]]. Saruman uses the power in his voice to sway [[Théoden]] to forgive him and make peace, and many of the [[Rohirrim]] are moved by his magic and are spell-bound. Unmoved, Gimli comments that Saruman's words cannot be trusted and that from Orthanc, help would mean ruin.  Saruman is angered enough by Gimli that for a moment he loses his charm.\n\nAs the fellowship of friends again began to break up – Gandalf and Pippin heading for [[Minas Tirith]], [[Théoden]] and his riders for [[Dunharrow]] – Gimli out of love and respect for Aragorn went with him, Legolas, the sons of Elrond, and the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] on the [[Paths of the Dead]].  He showed great reluctance before the [[Dark Door]], the final thought that drove him downward was the thought of being bested by an Elf underground.\n\nHe participated in the epic [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], returning with Aragorn and his other companions on the ships of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], and later recounted their journey to the fascinated Hobbits. He began to fear for Legolas, who seemed entranced by the Sea. His position on Elves completely changed, he remarked \"If all the fair folk take to the Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay\".<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref> He was much more sceptical as to the overall end of [[Men]] than his comrade.{{fact}}\n\nGimli fought in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], passing through unscathed, and finding the alive but bruised Pippin among the dead lying on the hill. He returned to the [[Field of Cormallen]] to be reunited with his friends, and there displayed open affection for all of them, even Pippin (\"If only because of the pains you have cost me, which I shall never forget\").<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>\n\n===After the War of the Ring===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Legolas and Gimli Reach the Shores of Valinor.jpg|thumb|right|''Gimli and Legolas reach the shores of Valinor'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]  \nAfter the coronation of Aragorn, Gimli said farewell to his old friend Éomer, who begged for pardon as to his words on Galadriel, though he added that he still didn’t think she was the fairest in the world. When he added that he considered [[Arwen]] the fairest instead, Gimli was content with this.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 975</ref>\n\nDuring the return journey he visited many places with Legolas, including Fangorn Forest and [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]]. Eventually he returned to Erebor, to find it nearly devastated by war. [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] had died, and [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]] was now King. Eventually, though, he returned to the Glittering Caves with a contingent of dwarves, becoming the \"[[Lord of the Glittering Caves]]\". He rebuilt the gates of Minas Tirith with ''[[mithril]]'' and steel, and in both [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]] accomplished great works. There he met his friends Merry and Pippin and the [[Appendix A|history of his people]] made its way to the [[Red Book]];<ref>{{App|A}}</ref> he also set out the genealogical tree of the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] for King Elessar.<ref name=appdurin/>\n\nIn Aglarond, it is assumed, he lived on until he was old, and in {{FoA|120}} he sailed with his friend Legolas across [[Belegaer]] to [[Valinor]], becoming the first and only Dwarf to do so.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Gimli.mp3|Ardamir}}\nIn [[1978]], [[Jim Allan]] noted that the name ''Gimli'' appears once in the ''[[Völuspá]]'' and three times in the ''Prose Edda''. Allan suggested that ''Gimli'' means \"One-of-Gimlé\" or \"One-of-Gimill\", where [[Wikipedia:Gimlé|''Gimlé''/''Gimill'']] in the ''Eddas'' is a hall of the after-life \"''inhabited solely by [[Calaquendi#Inspiration|Light-elves]]''\" (evoking Gimli's leaving for [[Aman]]). He also noted that the nominative form ''Gimlé'' of the dative form ''Gimli'' consists of the elements ''gim'' (\"fire\") and ''hlé'' (\"shelter\", \"lee\").<ref>[[Jim Allan]], \"Giving of Names\", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 225</ref>\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in a draft letter after he had been questioned about the name ''Gimli'' that the  poetic archaic [[Old Norse]] word ''gim'' seems to have meant \"fire\".<ref>{{L|297}}, p. 382</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | NAI | | | | | | | | | | | |NAI=[[Náin II]]<br/>''<small>{{TA|2338|n}} - {{TA|2585|n}}</small>''}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| DAI | | | | | | | | BOR | | | | | | |DAI=[[Dáin I]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2440|n}} - {{TA|2589|n}}''†</small>| BOR=[[Borin]]<br/>''<small>{{TA|2450|n}} - {{TA|2711|n}}</small>''}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| THR | | | | | | | | FAR | | | | | | |THR=[[Thrór]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2542|n}} - {{TA|2790|n}}''†</small>''|FAR=[[Farin]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2560|n}} - {{TA|2803|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | | | |,|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|.| | | |}}\n{{familytree| THR | | | | FUN | | | | | | GRO | | |THR=[[Thráin|Thráin II]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2644|n}} - {{TA|2850|n}}''†</small>|FUN=[[Fundin]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2662|n}} - {{TA|2799|n}}''†</small>|GRO=[[Gróin]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2671|n}} - {{TA|2923|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| THO | | BAL | | DWA | | OIN | | GLO |THO=[[Thorin]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2746|n}} - {{TA|2941|n}}''†</small>|BAL=[[Balin]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2763|n}} - {{TA|2994|n}}''†</small>|DWA=[[Dwalin]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2772|n}} - {{FoA|91}}''</small>|OIN=[[Óin]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2774|n}} - {{TA|2994|n}}''†</small>|GLO=[[Glóin]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2783|n}} - {{FoA|15}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | GIM |GIM='''GIMLI'''<br/><small>''{{TA|2879|n}} - {{FoA|120}}+''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe name \"[[Gimli (elf)|Gimli]]\" was first used by Tolkien for the name of a [[Gnome]] in the ''[[Tale of Tinúviel]]'', written in mid-1910s.<ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Adûnaic]] language described in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ([[1945]]), ''gimli'' (pl.

At one point in the series, when his companions in the Fellowship ask him if he heard a suspicious noise, he exclaims \"I only hear the whisper of stones and mosses\" (a possible reference to Tolkien's Dwarves being attuned to stone and the mountains as much as Elves are to the woods and sea).\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:[[John Rhys-Davies]] portrayed Gimli in voice and close-ups; Brett Beattie was his size-double. Jackson used the antagonism between Legolas and Gimli, although he placed most of it on Gimli's plate.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Gimli is portrayed as a burly lumberjack, slightly smaller than Legolas, but the same size as Boromir. His moment of glory is in [[Moria]], where he aids the player (at this point, Frodo) in trying to find the Bridge. He is voiced by [[James Horan]].\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:Now that [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] were no longer around to provide comic relief, Gimli was chosen to fill the spot. This has led to much criticism.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Gimli is one of the three playable characters.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:As in the second film Gimli's character was somewhat controversially used to insert comic relief into the scenes he appeared in.\n\n'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Gimli is a playable character, with an aggressive fighting style.

His first appearance is near the Lonely Mountain, where he and other dwarves fight orcs and later activate a giant catapult.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:Gimil is a Hero Unit for the Rohan faction in skirmishes, though he accompanies the Fellowship in the storyline mode.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Gimli is now the Hero for the Dwarven faction.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Gimli is first met by Dwarven characters in the intro taking place in {{TA|2941}}, shortly before the Quest for Erebor. Later, all characters meet him in Rivendell where Gimli accompanies them on a mission to the [[Misty Mountains]]. The player catches up with Gimli at several points during the Fellowship's journey and also fights alongside Gimli in the [[Glittering Caves]] during the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] and in Northern [[Ithilien]] during the [[Army of the West]]'s march towards the [[Black Gate]]. After the downfall of [[Sauron]], Gimli and Legolas join the [[Gondor]]ian army in exploring and securing the Land of Shadow. There, Gimli finds a dwarven clan from the East who have been used as skilled slaves by the Dark Lord for centuries. He leads the survivors to [[Erebor]] and secures King [[Thorin Stonehelm]]'s permission for them to reside in his halls, before returning south to [[Minas Tirith]] for the wedding of Aragorn and [[Arwen]].\n\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''\n:Gimli is a playable hero available in several missions.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Gimli can be found and talked to in Rivendell, he retains the appearance from the movies.

His adventure with the dwarves [[Thorin]] and [[Thorin and Company|Company]] earned him a fortune, and brought the [[One Ring]] of [[Sauron]] back into knowledge. \n\n==Personality==\nBefore his adventures, Bilbo was considered a very prim and respectable Hobbit for his polite disposition and aversion to anything out of the ordinary.  He had strict culinary and hygienic principles, being often less than thrilled with the rough conditions of travel at first.  But, being the son of [[Bungo Baggins]] and [[Belladonna Took]], Bilbo had blood from two important Hobbit families, the [[Baggins Family|Bagginses]] and the [[Took Family|Tooks]]. Because of his adventurous \"Tookish side\" (which sometimes conflicted with his stay-at-home \"Baggins side\"), Baggins was rather restless and \"strange\" for a Hobbit. After his return from Erebor, he was regarded much less fondly than before by his fellow Hobbits, but paid them no mind.  Though considering himself happily retired from adventures, he often left his home for many days to meet with old friends and strangers, including [[Dwarves]]. \n\nBilbo was noteworthy as the first [[Ring-bearers|ring-bearer]] in the history of [[Middle-earth]] to give up [[the One Ring]] voluntarily; he surrendered the ring to [[Frodo Baggins]] at [[Gandalf]]'s request.\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Miriam Ellis - The Old Took’s Fireworks, Midsummer’s Eve, 1301.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Bilbo and [[Drogo Baggins]] frolic at one of [[Gandalf]]'s fireworks shows - Art by [[Miriam Ellis]]]]\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Sketch of Bilbo Baggins.png|thumb|120px|Sketch of Bilbo Baggins by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nBilbo Baggins was born on [[September 22]] by [[Shire Reckoning]],<ref group=\"note\">How the date of Bilbo's (and Frodo's) birthday corresponds with our calendar is a matter of debate. [[Appendix D]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' says that our New Year's Day (January 1) corresponds \"more or less\" to the Shire's \"January 9\", and in standard years our September 14 and the Shire's \"September 22\" both fall 256 days after that date. However, Appendix D also says that the Shire calendar's \"[[Midyear's Day]]\" is \"intended to correspond as nearly as possible to the summer solstice.\" In the Shire calendar, \"September\" ([[Halimath]]) 22 is 83 days after Midyear's Day. If we take the summer solstice to be our June 21, then Bilbo's and Frodo's birthday must be 83 days later, which is our September 12.</ref> in the year {{TA|2890|n}} of the [[Third Age]], the son of [[Bungo Baggins]]  and [[Belladonna Took]]. He was a grandson of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]].<ref name=\"TA\" />\n\nDuring his youth, Bilbo attended several parties during which he loved to listen to [[Gandalf]]'s stories<ref name=\"Erebor\">{{UT|9}}</ref> about [[Dragons]], [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] and princesses and was impressed by the Wizard's fireworks. Bilbo also saw the [[Fell Winter]], and was the last hobbit by the End of the Third Age to remember it. His role in the Winter is unknown. After the death of his parents, respectively in {{TA|2926}} and {{TA|2934}}, he inherited [[Bag End]]. In the eyes of his neighbours, he originally seemed just like his father, a solid, sensible, unadventurous and respectable hobbit.<ref name=\"Party\">{{H|1}}</ref> But when becoming older he started to become \"strange\" and often left his home for many days to meet with strangers, including [[Dwarves]]. \n\nEventually, Gandalf came to believe that Bilbo was the ideal person for an important task he had at hand, for Bilbo was both small-sized and adventurous. Gandalf came to the Shire to visit him in {{TA|2941}} but he had disappeared again because of [[Yestarë|Elven new year]].<ref name=\"Erebor\" />\n\n===Quest of Erebor===\n[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - An Unexpected Party.jpg|thumb|left|\"An Unexpected Party\" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]\nGandalf managed to address him on a morning, while he sat outside his hobbit-hole. He reluctantly asked Gandalf for [[tea]] next day. Indeed Gandalf came back, bringing [[Thorin and Company|thirteen Dwarves]] with him. First came [[Dwalin]], followed by [[Balin]], next were [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]], then [[Dori]], [[Nori]], [[Ori]], [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]], and at last [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], [[Bombur]], [[Thorin]] and Gandalf. The Dwarves remained in Bag End for supper and afterwards [[Far over the misty mountains cold|sang a song]] about the [[Sack of Erebor]] and explained the reasons for their unannounced coming: the Dwarves were planning [[Quest of Erebor|a quest]] to reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]] (and its sizable hoard) from the Dragon [[Smaug]]; or, failing this, to at least recover a sizable amount of treasure from the dragon. Gandalf had volunteered Bilbo to be the company's burglar in order to accomplish these goals. Even with the Dwarves' protests and Bilbo's feeble objections, Gandalf convinced [[Thorin]] that Bilbo was the right person. Thus the Hobbit became the fourteenth member of [[Thorin and Company|the Company]] which left the Shire in {{TA|2941}}.<ref name=\"Party\" /> Bilbo's initial task was to steal as much treasure from Smaug's hoard as possible, as well as recover lost family heirlooms. However, Gandalf's foreboding shows that he instinctively knew that Bilbo's presence would be essential in bringing about Smaug's death and restoring the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].<ref name=\"Erebor\" />\n====Across Eriador====\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Trolls (Colored by H.E. Riddett).jpg|right|thumb|''The Trolls'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nThe next day, after assembling at the [[Green Dragon]], the company's journey to the Lonely Mountain began.  Thorin and company travelled through the [[Lone-lands]] along high hills and beside castles. After approximately one month, Gandalf disappeared. Oín and Gloín failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted a fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo to investigate.\n\nBilbo saw three [[Trolls]] when he approached the campfire. He tried to steal one of the Trolls' money purses but was discovered and captured by [[William]], one of the trolls. He escaped the trolls but was helpless to prevent all the dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him. Gandalf, however, came in the nick of time and saved them all by imitating the Trolls' voices. This led to an argument between the Trolls, who argued until dawn, when the sun turned the Trolls to stone. Upon discovery of a troll cave, Gandalf and Thorin took two fine elvish swords from the Trolls' treasure. Bilbo discovered a small elvish blade, no longer than a small knife in size.<ref>{{H|2}}</ref> He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.<ref name=\"Riddles\" />\n\nIn June they came to [[Rivendell]]. During their visit Bilbo met [[Elrond]], and became enchanted with the [[Elves]]. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the swords of Thorin and Gandalf, and looked at [[Thrór's Map]]. Elrond explained that the swords were forged in [[Gondolin]] and were named [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]]. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon letters that spoke of the [[Back Door|back door of Erebor]], which read:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{H|3}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.|{{H|3}}}}\n\n====Over the Misty Mountains====\n[[File:Donato Giancola - The Hobbit - Expulsion.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Expulsion'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]]\nThe next day the company left Rivendell<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> and found, with Elrond's advice, the correct way over the [[Misty Mountains]], the [[High Pass]]. During a stormy night, the company took shelter in a dry cave. When everybody was sleeping, [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] appeared and took their ponies to [[Goblin-town]]. At this moment Bilbo woke up and after seeing that the ponies had disappeared, yelled. Goblins swarmed the cave and captured Bilbo and the dwarves. But thanks to Bilbo's yell, Gandalf awakened in time and avoided capture. Bilbo and the dwarves were brought before the [[Great Goblin]]. When he saw Thorin's sword, Orcrist, he was enraged and wanted to kill Thorin and his companions. But Gandalf came in time to save them and killed the Great Goblin. While escaping, Bilbo was carried by Dori. But when a goblin attacked Dori, he dropped Bilbo.<ref>{{H|4}}</ref>\n[[File:Daniel Govar - Riddles in the Dark.jpg|thumb|150px|left|\"Riddles in the Dark\" by [[Daniel Govar]]]]\nWhen Bilbo's consciousness returned he picked up a strange [[The One Ring|golden ring]]. After wandering through the dark passages he came to the lake of [[Gollum]]. Gollum, desiring to eat the hobbit but not willing to face his blade, engaged in a riddle contest. If Bilbo won, according to the predetermined rules, Gollum would lead him to safety. If Gollum won, Bilbo would allow himself to be eaten. As Bilbo saw no other way to escape, he agreed with Gollum's proposal.<ref name=\"Riddles\">{{H|5}}</ref>\n[[File:Cor Blok - The Game of Riddles.jpg|thumb|\"[[Riddle-game|The Game of Riddles]]\" by [[Cor Blok]]]]\nBilbo won the contest by accident, wondering out loud as he fingered the ring he had picked up, \"What have I got in my pocket?\" Gollum mistook this for a question, and Bilbo decided to stick to it. Gollum lost, but went back to his little island to take the ring Bilbo had picked up (as it was a magic ring) to turn himself invisible and kill the hobbit anyway. But of course the ring was not there, and Gollum, enraged, suddenly guessed that Bilbo had it. He chased Bilbo, but Bilbo unwittingly used the ring and escaped his notice. Gollum led Bilbo to the eastern door of the goblin-tunnels, through which Bilbo departed in safety.<ref name=\"Riddles\" /> Soon after leaving the caves Bilbo found his companions and used the Ring to slip past Balin, the look-out. [[Balin]] was very impressed that he hadn't noticed Bilbo and his reputation among the dwarves increased. Bilbo told Gandalf and the dwarves about his encounter with Gollum and his escape, but he said nothing of the ring. Thus he rejoined his fellow adventurers.<ref name=\"Pan\">{{H|6}}</ref>\n\nThe company had not journeyed long when they heard the howl of a [[Wargs|Warg]]. On Gandalf's order they climbed in a group of trees. Bilbo, however, was not able to climb in one of the trees:<ref name=\"Pan\" />\n{{blockquote|He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it.|{{H|6}}}}\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Bilbo woke with the early sun in his eyes.jpg|thumb|\"Bilbo woke with the early sun in his eyes\" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nWith the help of Dori, Bilbo managed to climb in one of the trees. Immediately thereafter, hundreds of Wargs arrived. Gandalf kept them at bay with pyrotechnical pinecones, but eventually goblins came and set the trees on fire.  Even Gandalf had begun to despair when the [[Eagles]] of [[Gwaihir]] came to rescue them, taking Bilbo last. The Eagles brought them first to [[Eagle's Eyrie|a wide shelf of rock on the mountain-side]], where they spent the night,<ref name=\"Pan\" /> and then to the [[Carrock]].<ref name=\"Queer\">{{H|7}}</ref> Bilbo did not enjoy his experience being carried by his rescuers, apparently suffering from a fear of heights.<ref name=\"Pan\" />\n\n====Across Wilderland====\nFrom the Carrock they came to [[Beorn]]'s [[Beorn's Hall|Hall]]. Gandalf took only Bilbo at first, but with a story introduced the dwarves in pairs of two, convincing Beorn to invite them for dinner. Bilbo slept uneasily, fearing to be killed by Beorn, while the company spent the night in Beorn's hall. They remained in Beorn's hall, while Beorn had disappeared, for the next two days. On the third day of their stay Beorn returned and gave them mounts, bows, and stocks. He also provided them with council for their coming journey. They departed Beorn's house and travelled three days before they arrived at the edge of [[Mirkwood]]. Bilbo alone (and perhaps Gandalf) noticed that a bear still followed them. At the edge of Mirkwood they returned the ponies, and Gandalf said farewell to Bilbo and the Dwarves. Bilbo was saddened by Gandalf's parting.<ref name=\"Queer\" />\n\nAfter many days' journey the company came to the [[Enchanted River]]. Bilbo noted that there was a boat at the other shore. Fíli threw an iron hook to grapple the boat and pulled it across the river toward them. The company crossed the river in pairs. While crossing the river, Bombur fell in. They rescued him, but he was asleep because of the river's magic and had to be carried on a litter. Eventually, the dwarves started to give up hope and sent Bilbo to climb a tree midway through the wood. Bilbo declared he could see only trees, not realising they were at the bottom of a bowl formation. Giving up hope, the company noticed campfires of the feasting [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] and, despite the warnings of Beorn and Gandalf, they left the [[Old Forest Road|road]] to contact the elves. However, whenever the company tried to contact them, they extinguished the fires, leaving a complete darkness in the forest, and disappeared suddenly. Thrice the dwarves tried to contact the Elves but all of their attempts failed. After their third attempt Bilbo lost his companions.<ref name=\"Flies\">{{H|8}}</ref>\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Butterflies Above Mirkwood.jpg|thumb|\"[[Butterflies]] above [[Mirkwood]]\" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nLater, a [[Spiders|spider]] attacked Bilbo, who had fallen asleep. Bilbo woke up in time to defend himself with his little blade. He named his blade ''[[Sting]]'' after his first kill. Bilbo discovered that his companions had been captured by the spiders and stowed in their webs. Calling the spiders' names, he lured them away (with [[The One Ring|his ring]]) and came back to rescue the Dwarves. When the spiders returned, the dwarves fought them in a long battle. Eventually, the company won with no serious injuries, but found out that Thorin was missing. Unknown to Bilbo and the other Dwarves, he had been captured by the Wood-elves whose feasts they had interrupted.<ref name=\"Flies\" /> Shortly after the fight with the spiders the remaining members of the company were also captured and brought before [[Thranduil]], king of Mirkwood. Bilbo, with his ring, escaped notice and thus capture. He followed the elves into the [[Elvenking's Halls]], where the dwarves refused to tell their errand to Thranduil and were locked up.<ref name=\"Barrels\">{{H|9}}</ref> \n\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves (II).jpg|200px|thumb|\"Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves\" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nLater, exploring the elven halls with the aid of his magic ring, Bilbo discovered that Thorin was also captured by Thranduil and devised a plan for the dwarves to escape. One day, [[Galion]] (Thranduil's butler) and the head of the guard, were drunk, and Bilbo was able to steal the keys. He freed the Dwarves from their cells and packed them in barrels. His plan worked, with the dwarves being packed and launched into the [[Forest River]].  Poor Bilbo was forced to cling to the barrels, invisible, and grew cold and wet.<ref name=\"Barrels\" />\n\n{{blockquote|He came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts he could not scramble on top. Every time he tried, the barrel rolled round and ducked him under again. It was really empty, and floated light as a cork. Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar above.|{{H|9}}}}\n\nUpon reaching the [[Long Lake]], Bilbo, with the aid of Thorin, Fili and Kili, searched for the barrels with Dwarves and freed them. They then went to [[Lake-town]], where they received a warm welcome. The [[Master of Lake-town]] invited Thorin and his companions to the feast he'd organised. Despite the feigned hospitality of the [[Master of Lake-town]] and his people Bilbo had an awful cold and could hardly say anything during the banquet. The company stayed two weeks in Lake-town. They were given new ponies and provisions for many days, and they were brought, by boat, to the northern tip of the Long Lake.<ref>{{H|10}}</ref>\n\n====Encounter with the Dragon====\nOn their way again, the party came to the [[Lonely Mountain]] when autumn waned. Thorin sent Balin, Fíli, Kíli and Bilbo to spy the [[Front Gate]]. Bilbo saw smoke coming out of the front gate, which made the party assume that Smaug was still alive. They returned to their camp and at Bilbo's suggestion they started to search for the [[Back Door]] at the western slopes of the Lonely Mountain. Eventually, the company discovered the back door. But none of them were able to open it, and Bilbo sat for days on the doorstep, thinking.  Soon the dwarves began to grumble about the hobbit, but Bilbo finally solved the riddle of the thrush knocking at the last light of Durin's Day:<ref name=\"Doorstep\">{{H|11}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|At the very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled with dark spots. Crack! It had caught a snail and was knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack!<br/>Suddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the dwarves, shouting and waving.|{{H|11}}}}\n[[File:Olanda Fong-Surdenas - Smaug the Mighty.jpg|thumb|left|''Smaug the Mighty'' by [[Olanda Fong-Surdenas]]]] \nThe dwarves found that he was right, and with the key managed to open the passage.<ref name=\"Doorstep\" /> Bilbo was, of course, elected to enter the passage first, taking only [[Balin]] with him. Soon Balin halted, but Bilbo went on, finding Smaug's lair and stealing a single jewelled cup before returning. While the Dwarves passed the retrieved treasure to each other and praised Bilbo for his deed, they heard the mountain rumbling. Bilbo had done ill in this, Smaug had awoken and was raged when he missed his cup. Smaug ravaged the mountain and the dwarves were forced to hide in the tunnel, though they lost their ponies. Despite their grumbling, the dwarves had begun to rely on Bilbo's advice for their course of action, and agreed to wait. Bilbo soon decided, however, to return and try and find a weakness in Smaug.  Slipping on his ring, he approached the dragon's hoard.<ref name=\"Inside\">{{H|12}}</ref>\n\nGandalf had indeed done well in choosing Bilbo, for the old worm did not recognise Bilbo's scent, neither could see him, and was puzzled.  Nevertheless he sensed the hobbit's presence, and challenged him. Knowing that it would be unwise to reveal his true name or stay quiet, Bilbo replied with a series of riddles, which no dragon can resist puzzling out.  Bilbo gave himself a series of names such as \"[[Ringwinner]]\" and \"[[Luck]]wearer\", referring to his adventures on the way to the Mountain.  Becoming pleased with his riddling, one of the names Bilbo conferred upon himself was \"Barrel-rider\", and flattered the dragon:<ref name=\"Inside\" /> \n\n{{Blockquote|\"Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear you breathe. Come along! Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!\"<br/>But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug hoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed. \"No thank you, O Smaug the Tremendous!\" he replied.<br/>\"I did not come for presents. I only wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great as tales say. I did not believe them.\"<br/>\"Do you now?\" said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he did not believe a word of it.<br/>\"Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities,\" replied Bilbo.<br/>\"You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,\" said the dragon.|{{H|12}}}}\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Scouring the Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Scouring the Mountain'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThis confrontation did not last especially long, for Bilbo tricked Smaug into showing his underside. Bilbo then saw the gap in the dragon's hard scales, an unprotected place.  Bilbo, upon seeing this, cracked a joke and hastily departed, and for this was nearly burned to death. All the same, he escaped and recovered, and told the dwarves what he had learned. This indirectly aided the company, for a [[Thrushes|thrush]] overheard, and this would prove beneficial in the end.<ref name=\"Inside\" />\n\n====Death of Smaug====\nAs darkness fell, Bilbo urged the dwarves to close the door for fear of Smaug's vengeance. Reluctantly, but at last, they gave in. Just as the door closed, Smaug ravaged the side of the mountain, blocking up the door and destroying the doorstep. However, by mentioning the word \"Barrel-rider\", Bilbo had led Smaug to believe that the company had been aided by the people of Laketown.<ref name=\"Inside\" /> Thus, Smaug wreaked his vengeance on Laketown. Smaug destroyed the town, but one company of archers, led by [[Bard]], resisted the dragon. When his last arrow, the [[black arrow]], remained, a thrush, who had overheard Bilbo talking about the unprotected patch of Smaug's skin, fluttered around Bard's shoulder. The Thrush passed his knowledge on to Bard who, armed with the knowledge, shot Smaug dead. Smaug fell onto the town, which was devastated by the dragon's attack, but Bard survived and swam to the shores of the lake. There, Bard, an heir of [[Girion]] of [[Dale]], was proclaimed by the people to be king of restored Dale. Bard summoned [[Thranduil]] to help rebuild Laketown and Dale in return for part of the treasure. The armies of Mirkwood and Lake-town joined together and marched to the Lonely Mountain to take their share of the treasure.<ref>{{H|14}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and the dwarves decided to inspect the hoard while Smaug was away. During this time Bilbo stumbled across a gigantic and beautiful gem. Recalling an earlier conversation, Bilbo realised that it was the famous [[Arkenstone]], but felt strangely reluctant to give it up. Instead, he put it in his pocket and continued on. After a song and gathering of treasure, Thorin gave Bilbo a beautiful [[Mithril-coat|coat]] of ''[[mithril]]'' as the first reward for his services. Thorin led the party to the front gate, and then Balin led them to the [[guardroom]], where they sheltered.<ref>{{H|13}}</ref>\n\nAfter Bilbo and his companions awoke the next morning they found that many birds, including the aforementioned Trush, assembled at the Lonely Mountain. Although the Thrush tried to say something to the company, none of them could understand him. Therefore the Thrush summoned the [[Ravens|raven]] [[Roäc]], who was able to speak [[Westron]]. Roäc told Bilbo and the dwarves about the events in Lake-town and told Thorin about the approaching armies. He counselled them to make peace with Bard and Thranduil, though it cost them dearly in gold. Thorin rejected this advice and announced that he would not share the treasure with anyone. Then, Thorin sent Roäc as a messenger to his cousin [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]], lord of the [[Iron Hills]], to request aid. The next days they made preparations and blocked the gate with a wall, while they received news from the ravens.<ref name=\"Gathering\">{{H|15}}</ref>\n\n====The Battle of Five Armies and return journey====\n{{Blockquote|There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.|[[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]], ''[[The Return Journey]]''}}\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Arkenstone.jpg|thumb|\"[[Arkenstone|The Arkenstone]]\" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nWhen Bard and Thranduil came to the Front gate, Thorin harshly responded in polite words to Bard.  Bard's reasoning did little for the stubborn King under the Mountain and Thorin rejected Bard's proposal to share the treasure.<ref name=\"Gathering\" /> Bilbo feared war, and to prevent this gave the Arkenstone into the hands of [[Bard]] for negotiation.  With the praise of Bard, Thranduil, and Gandalf he returned, only to be rejected and cast away for his deed by Thorin.  But Bilbo was successful in that Thorin was willing to negotiate, and war was prevented temporarily.\n\nAnd yet war did come. [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]], at the summons of Thorin, came from the [[Iron Hills]] with an army of Dwarves. Bard refused to let the dwarves enter the mountain, which would mean a long and almost certainly unsuccessful siege. But just as battle was about to be joined, Gandalf called them all to be wary of the new coming danger - the alliance of [[Wargs]] and [[Orcs|Goblins]] against them.  Dáin, Bard, and Thranduil took council together, and decided upon a strategy of defending the slopes of the Lonely Mountain.  Then the enemy came.  Thus was the [[Battle of Five Armies]] fought.\n[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Death of Thorin Oakenshield.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Thorin Oakenshield'' by [[Darrell Sweet]]]]\nDuring the battle Bilbo stood with Thranduil and Gandalf on [[Ravenhill]].  As the battle went against the Men, Dwarves, and Elves, Bilbo reflected gloomily on the ingloriousness of war and the bitterness of the end.  But then the [[Eagles]] of [[Gwaihir]] came, and [[Beorn]] too, and the battle was won.  But Bilbo did not see this result, for a falling stone knocked him out.  Invisible as he was, his bruised body was not discovered until the next day.  Bilbo then bade farewell to the mortally wounded Thorin and his other friends.  \n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Hall at Bag-End, Residence of B. Baggins Esquire (Colored by H.E. Riddett).jpg|thumb|right|''The Hall at Bag-End, Residence of B. Baggins Esquire'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nThe victors divided the treasure and Bard took Bilbo's fourteenth share of the gold and silver in return for the Arkenstone. Bilbo, despite having forfeited his share, was offered a rich reward but refused to take more than two small chests of gold and silver. When Bilbo and Gandalf bid farewell to Thranduil Bilbo gave him a necklace of silver and pearls. Thranduil gave the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] the title \"[[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]]\" and then he returned with Gandalf to [[the Shire]]. There he discovered that he was believed dead, and an auction was going on of his house and possessions. He bought back his own things, and settled once more peacefully into [[Bag End]].\n\n===Years between===\n[[File:Michele Mantoani - Bilbo Baggins.jpg|thumb|\"Bilbo Baggins\" by [[:Category:Images by Michele Mantoani|Michele Mantoani]]]]\nBilbo lived on in health and comfort. He was considered somewhat of an oddity, because of his unexplained wealth and his travelling nature and also because he stopped growing old at 50, these of course having their explanation in his previous adventure.<ref name=\"party\">{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally he received strange visitors; dwarves or Gandalf, or he often left the Shire for journeys from time to time. Other hobbits looked at him with amazement and suspicion, but his generous and kind nature put him high in the regard of those who knew him best especially the poorest and less significant hobbits.<ref name=\"party\" />\n\nAlthough he had no close friends, he maintained visiting relations with his relatives (except the [[Sackville-Bagginses]]) and especially favored young [[Frodo Baggins]], his cousin from both the side of his father and mother; and with whom they shared same birthday. Frodo was an orphan living in [[Brandy Hall]], crowded with \"queer\" [[Bucklanders|Bucklander]] [[Brandybuck Family|relatives]], until {{TA|2989}} when Bilbo adopted Frodo as his heir, and raised him in Bag End. Together they celebrated lively their common birthdays and Bilbo was notorious for his (inevitable) after-dinner speeches, reciting boring poetry and, after drinking, allusions to his absurd adventures.<ref name=\"party\" /> The two went often out for long walks along the lanes of the [[Water-valley]] and talked about adventure; they were often seen by [[Wandering Companies]] of [[Elves]] (although the hobbits did not see them). When they returned home Bilbo often told Frodo that the Road is like a big dangerous river and all porches are its \"springs\" and all paths are its \"tributaries\".<ref name=\"three\" />\n\nMost of his time was spent reading, writing [[There and Back Again|his memoirs]], which only Frodo was allowed to read, writing poetry, translating [[Elvish]] and avoiding his nasty relatives. Young [[Sam Gamgee]] started helping [[Hamfast Gamgee|his father]] tending the garden, whom Bilbo taught reading and writing and also some poetry and lore,<ref name=\"party\" /> such as ''[[The Fall of Gil-galad]]'' (which Sam wrongly believed Bilbo composed himself).<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref>\n\nDespite his health and youthfulness, Bilbo himself began to feel ''stretched'' and thin. As time passed and he used his magic ring (and perhaps because of [[Sauron]]'s growing power), his mind was preoccupied with it, often worrying if it is safe and checking on it; once he tried locking it somewhere but he couldn't relax if it wasn't in his pocket, and wanted to use it more often. Sometimes he felt it like \"an eye\" watching on him.<ref name=\"party\" />\n\n===Bilbo's Farewell Party===\n[[File:Livia Prima - Bilbo's Party.jpg|thumb|\"[[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's Party]]\" by [[:Category:Images by Livia Prima|Livia Prime]]]]\nAt last, in September of {{TA|3001}}, Bilbo threw a [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|grand party]] for his 111th birthday (which happened to be shared with Frodo) that was long prepared and Bilbo became the favourite matter of gossip for the region. During this party he gave [[Bilbo’s Birthday Speech|a speech]], did a vanishing act with his ring and sneaked to Bag End. He only took with him a [[There and Back Again|book]] that he was composing, his sword [[Sting]], his [[mithril coat]], and a dark green hood and cloak which had been given to him by [[Thorin]] years before. He attempted to leave the Ring for Frodo, along with [[Bag End]] and the rest of his possessions, but had an internal struggle; he left it only thanks to the urging of Gandalf, and Bilbo was the first ringbearer to give up the One Ring in this way. [[Nar (companion of Bilbo)|Three]] [[Anar (dwarf)|Dwarven]] [[Hannar|companions]] were working on his farewell gifts, and left for the east with them.<ref name=\"party\" />\n\nOn his way to the east he passed through [[Woody End]] and said farewell to [[Gildor]] and other [[Elves]] at their encampment above [[Woodhall]].<ref name=\"three\">{{FR|Three}}</ref> The [[Third Age 3002|next year]] he visited Rivendell and became a guest of Elrond<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> and apparently he met Gildor once more again around there.<ref name=\"three\" /><ref group=\"note\">Gildor says he met Bilbo a second time far from the Shire, and as Gildor presumably is one of the [[Elves of Rivendell]], it's possible they met at or near Rivendell.</ref>\n\n===End of the Third Age===\n[[File:Andrea Piparo - Bilbo in Rivendell.jpg|thumb|''Bilbo in Rivendell'' by [[:Category:Images by Andrea Piparo|Andrea Piparo]]]]\nHe lived a very pleasant life of retirement in Rivendell: eating, sleeping, writing poetry, and working on his memoir, ''[[There and Back Again]]'' and wrote a book called ''[[Translations from the Elvish]]''.\n\nWhen Frodo came to Rivendell seventeen years later, they reunited in the [[Hall of Fire]]. While alone, Bilbo mentioned his old ring to Frodo, wishing to see it, but Frodo refused and a shadow fell upon the two. Bilbo briefly turned into a fleshy figure, though he quickly apologized. Shortly afterwards Bilbo finishes composing (with [[Aragorn]]; whom he calls the ''[[Dúnadan]]'') the ''[[Eärendillinwë]]''.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>\n\nBilbo attended the [[Council of Elrond]], offering to take the Ring to [[Mount Doom]].  Nevertheless, this task fell to the younger Frodo, and in farewell Bilbo gave him [[Sting]] and his old ''mithril'' coat, both of which served Frodo well in the struggles to come.\n\nThe [[War of the Ring]] was fought far from where Bilbo dwelt, but successfully, and in the end Frodo returned home. Because of the Ring's destruction, that prolonged his life, Bilbo started ageing again; as [[Arwen]] told to Frodo later, Bilbo started looking ancient according to his kind.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>\n\n===Passage west===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Departure at the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|''Departure at the Grey Havens'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nTwo years later, however, Bilbo as a former ringbearer accompanied Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, and certain Elves to the [[Grey Havens]], there to take ship for the West, on [[29 September]], {{TA|3021}}. He had already celebrated his 131st birthday, becoming the oldest Hobbit in the history of Middle-earth. As a mortal, he died in the West.\n\nWhile sailing west, Bilbo composed [[Bilbo's Last Song|a last poem]] looking back on Middle-earth in farewell.\n\n==Legacy==\nAlready an eccentric during his life in Hobbiton, the disappearance of the \"Mad Baggins\"  was a long-lasting discussion around the Shire. Many speculated that he got mad and seeking adventures he found his death in a river or pool, with Gandalf being responsible for not letting him settle down. Meanwhile Frodo, knowing that he is alive and well somewhere, continued to honor Bilbo's birthday along with his, every year.<ref name=\"shadow\" /> Bilbo thus was one of the many legendary hobbits that were incited by Gandalf to seek adventures; and other hobbit figures of traditions (such as his uncles [[Hildifons Took|Hildifons]] and [[Isengar Took|Isengar]]<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> or [[Basso Boffin]]) that were taken by the 'wandering-madness', either lost for ever, or returning to remain eccentric and uncommunicable.<ref>{{AB|Foreword}}</ref>\n\nMany years after his second \"disappearance\" he became a fireside-story for hobbit-children, a legendary figure who used to vanish magically and reappear with bags of treasure.<ref name=\"shadow\">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>\n\nSam Gamgee named his tenth child [[Bilbo Gardner|Bilbo]] after his hero.<ref>{{App|Samwise}}</ref>\n\nThe keepers of the Red Book who copied and translated it were unwilling to make alterations to Bilbo's own text, out of respect for the hero of old, and stuck close to it and its faults.

To everyone’s surprise, including his own, Bilbo’s wit and courage prove that there is indeed more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.|[[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=\"HobbitApp\">{{webcite|author=[[Warner Bros.]]|articleurl=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hobbit-movies/id545808528|articlename=Hobbit Movies|dated=7-September-2012|website=[http://itunes.apple.com/ Apple iPhone/iPad App]|accessed=19-September-2012}}</ref>}}\n\n===Radio series===\n'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Bilbo is provided by [[Felix Felton]].\n\n'''1968: [[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|''The Hobbit'' (1968 radio series)]]:'''\n:Bilbo is portrayed by [[Paul Daneman]], and several times, when he introduces himself, he spells out his last name (\"B-A-GG-I-N-S\").\n\n'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Bilbo is provided by [[Ray Reinhardt]].\n\n'''1979: [[The Hobbit (1979 radio series)|''The Hobbit'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Bilbo is provided by [[Ray Reinhardt]].\n\n'''1980: [[Der Hobbit (1980 German radio series)|''Der Hobbit'' (1980 German radio series)]]:'''\n:Bilbo is played by Horst Bollman.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Bilbo is portrayed by [[John Le Mesurier]].\n\n'''1989: [[Hobit (1989 Slovak radio series)|''Hobit'' (1989 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Bilbo Baggins is provided by Peter Bzdúch.\n\n'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''\n:Bilbo is played by Klaus Herm.\n\n'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Bilbo Baggins is provided by Marián Labuda. Though Bilbo appears as a character in the same scenes he does in the novel's narrative, his primary role is that of an omniscient, overarching narrator of the entire series. This is portrayed as Bilbo reading from and commenting on the War of the Ring while writing new chapters in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]]. There is a slightly metafictional or postmodern tone to Bilbo's narration, as he occasionally breaks the fourth wall and addresses his nephew Frodo (and sometimes other characters from the Fellowship) directly, with Frodo or the other characters sometimes equally breaking the fourth wall and briefly responding to Bilbo. Until his journey to the Grey Havens at the end of the story, Bilbo spends almost its entirety in Rivendell (from where he narrates and writes the Red Book and notes for it). The prologue about hobbits and the events of his 111th birthday are briefly summarized by Bilbo at the start of the first episode and then the action shifts towards Frodo and Gandalf, and then to Frodo and his three hobbit companions.\n\n===Video games===\n'''1982: [[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (1982 video game)]]:'''\n:Bilbo Baggins is the main character of the game.

Here at the end of all things, Sam|[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"[[Mount Doom]]\"}}</center>\n\n'''Samwise Gamgee''', commonly known as '''Sam''', was [[Frodo Baggins]]' servant and the only original member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] to remain with him to the very end of the journey to [[Mount Doom]].\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nSamwise lived with his father, [[Hamfast Gamgee]], better known as \"The Gaffer\", on [[Bagshot Row]] in [[The Shire]], close to [[Bag End]]. Sam's mother was [[Bell Gamgee|Bell Goodchild]]; he had five siblings: [[Hamson Gamgee|Hamson]], [[Halfred Gamgee|Halfred]], [[Daisy Gamgee|Daisy]], [[May Gamgee|May]], and [[Marigold Gamgee|Marigold]]. He was a friend of the [[Cotton Family|Cotton family]] and used to play in [[Bywater Pool]] with [[Wilcome Cotton II|Jolly]], [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Tom]], [[Carl Cotton|Nibs]], and [[Rose Cotton|Rosie Cotton]] specifically.<ref>{{RK|VI3}}</ref>\n\nA gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of plain speech. He helped his Gaffer tending the garden of Bag End and was taught the art of rope making by his [[Hobson|grandfather]] and his uncle [[Andwise Roper|Andy]]. In his work at Bag-End, he was acquainted with [[Bilbo Baggins]]. Bilbo taught him [[tengwar|letters]], and nurtured his love for [[Elves]], poetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most hobbits are aware of. This set him apart from the beginning to the Gaffer's dismay.<ref>{{FR|Party}};{{TT|Taming}}</ref> Sam often wandered outside [[Hobbiton]] and knew well the area twenty miles around.<ref name=three>{{FR|Three}}</ref>\n\nOn [[12 April]] Sam was in ''[[The Green Dragon]]'' and discussed with [[Ted Sandyman]] the strange rumours he heard around the Shire, including his [[Hal Gamgee|cousin Hal]] seeing a [[Tree-men|Tree-man]], and the [[Elves]] who leave [[Middle-earth]]. Ted called his cousin crazy and dismissed all rumours. In the evening, he returned to [[Hobbiton Hill]] thinking about the hard work he has to do when he saw [[Gandalf]] arriving to visit Frodo, after many years.<ref name=shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>\n\n===Eavesdropping on Frodo and Gandalf===\nSam was one of the \"[[Conspirators]]\" who were summoned by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] in order to watch over [[Frodo Baggins]] and the [[The One Ring|Ring]] inherited by Frodo from Bilbo. Being the closest to Frodo, Sam was their \"chief investigator\" who was to eavesdrop on his talks with Gandalf the [[Wizards|Wizard]].<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref>\n\nHe eavesdrops on Frodo and Gandalf's discussion while working at the garden of Bag End. It was when Gandalf revealed to Frodo that Bilbo's ring is [[Sauron]]'s One Ring, and on the mention that Frodo must leave the Shire, Sam choked. Initially suspected as a spy, Sam feigned innocent curiosity. Sam begged Gandalf not to turn him into anything \"unnatural\". Sam then immediately asked to be taken to see Elves when they went away. Gandalf decided to make Sam Frodo's first companion.<ref name=shadow/> \n\n===From Hobbiton to Crickhollow===\nSam joined Frodo on his journey to [[Bree]] and [[Rivendell]], as to outside appearances as Frodo's gardener. He lied that he had the lightest baggage after Frodo complained about the weight of his, and he offered to take more. Sam and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin Took]] followed Frodo to his new house at [[Crickhollow]] and when they were encountered by [[Black Riders]] Sam mentioned that one of those was asking his father about Frodo. Later they met one of the [[Wandering Companies]] of Elves; the experience of meeting Elves the first time left him speechless (although they were different than he expected, ''\"so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were,\"'' as Sam described them<ref name=\"short\">{{FR|Mushrooms}}, p. 87</ref>); the hobbits camped with them and Sam was like in a living dream, mentioning it as one of the most important events of his life. He was enchanted especially by their singing.<ref name=three/> The Elves warned him not to leave Frodo on his journey, and Sam denied he would ever think about it.<ref name=short/>\n\nThe next day Sam insisted that Pippin should leave some elven bread for their breakfast. That morning, Sam felt changed, feeling that he had to fulfill a role that lies beyond the Shire, something more important than meeting Elves or [[dragons]] or seeing mountains.<ref name=short/>\n\nAt Crickhollow where his and the Conspirators' role was revealed. Merry joined the travellers on their way to Bree.\n\n===Crickhollow to Rivendell===\nThe hobbits decided to risk travelling through the [[Old Forest]] to avoid Black Riders. There [[Old Man Willow]] put a spell of sleepiness on the four hobbits. Once Merry and Pippin slept by the tree and Frodo bathed his feet in the [[Withywindle]], the willow tree tried to drown Frodo and swallowed Merry and Pippin, but Sam proved the most resistant. He saved Frodo from drowning and tried to start a fire to frighten Old Man Willow but the tree threatened to squeeze the hobbits in two if he did not put it out. They were saved by Tom Bombadil and stayed in his house for two days. Sam was the only hobbit who slept contentedly.<ref>{{FR|Forest}}; {{FR|Bombadil}}</ref>\n\nThey passed through [[Barrow-downs]] and came to [[the Prancing Pony]] at Bree where they were joined by \"[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]\". Sam did not trust the ranger at first, but Frodo accepted his help as they could not get to Rivendell otherwise. [[Sauron]]'s spies had opened the stables of the inn and all the mounts went loose, therefore before leaving the village, the company purchased a [[Ponies|pony]] from [[Bill Ferny]]. Sam loved and tended the animal, and named him [[Bill the Pony|Bill]], after his owner. Upon their departure, Bill Ferney saw and taunted them. In response, Sam threw an apple at his head.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}; {{FR|Strider}}; {{FR|Knife}}</ref>\n\nAs they came to [[Weathertop]], Sam recited a poem about Gil-Galad that Bilbo had taught him.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}, p. 186</ref> After Frodo was stabbed by a Ringwraith, his distrust toward Strider only grew, and he was distraught when he learned that Frodo's wound might subdue him to the Black Riders' will. When the group came to the old place where [[Tom]], [[Bert]], and [[William]] had been turned to stone, he sang \"[[The Stone Troll]]\", an original composition of his, for the others.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref>\n\n===Fellowship of the Ring===\nWhen they reached [[Rivendell]], Sam was beside Frodo's bed while he was recovering from the [[Morgul-wound]] he was inflicted on Weathertop and hardly left except to run messages. Once Frodo awoke, Sam led him to join the rest of the party. He had begged to wait on Frodo but was told that for this time he was a guest of honor. When Frodo reunited with Bilbo, Sam sat near near them and listened as they spoke together until he fell asleep.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>\n\nThe following day, Sam eavesdropped on the [[Council of Elrond]] and remained silent until it was revealed that Frodo would be the [[Ring-bearers|Ringbearer]]. Then Sam was unable to contain himself any longer and revealed himself, asking if Frodo was meant to go alone, to which [[Elrond]] responded that he at least should accompany Frodo as it is impossible to separate them, even when Frodo is invited to a secret council and Sam is not.<ref>{{FR|Many}}; {{FR|Council}}, p. 270-271</ref>\n\n[[File:John_Howe_-_Watcher_in_the_Water.jpg‎|thumb|150px|left|''Watcher in the Water'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nSam insisted on bringing Bill along on the journey, saying he would pine if he did not come. At that point, he lamented that he had not brought rope but found that it was too late to find some now.<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 280</ref> Sam was dismayed when he learned they were to enter [[Moria]], and he was even more dismayed that they had to send Bill away when they entered Moria when wolves were about. Sam saved Frodo's life as the [[Watcher in the Water]] tried to seize him with one of its tentacles. As they passed by  fissures and chasms there, Sam once again remarked that he wished he had brought rope. Sam received a scratch along his scalp for his first orc kill in the mines. When Frodo was pinned against the wall by an Orc-spear, Sam hacked and broke the spear-shaft.<ref>{{FR|Journey}};{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Lothlórien]], the Elves remarked that Sam breathed so loudly that they could shoot him in the dark. Sam was the only one of the four hobbits who had no trouble sleeping upon the Elves' [[flet]], and he remarked that he will go on sleeping whether or not he rolled off in his slumber.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}, p. 342, 344</ref> In [[Cerin Amroth]], once the Fellowship was unblindfolded, Sam was surprised by the bright daylight in an Elven realm, and he remarked that he \"thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than anything I ever heard tell of\".<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}, p. 351</ref>\n\nSam made a verse in honour of Gandalf's fireworks. He, along with Frodo, looked into the [[Mirror of Galadriel]] where he saw trees being felled and that the Old Mill had been replaced by a large red-brick building. Sam considered going back to help those at home, but, being warned by [[Galadriel]] not to let the mirror decide his choices, Sam decided to finish his task with Frodo. At their parting from Lórien, Galadriel [[Gifts of Galadriel|gave]] Sam a [[Sam's garden box|box]] containing earth from her orchard.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}};{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>\n\n===Journey to Mordor===\nAt the [[Falls of Rauros]] Frodo tried to leave the Fellowship secretly by boat, but Sam pursued him and leapt into the water although he could not swim. Thus after the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], Sam was the only member of the Fellowship to remain with Frodo.<ref name=\"breaking\"/>\n[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - Faramir.png|thumb|250px|\"[[Faramir]]\" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]\nWhen [[Gollum]] joined up with them, Sam remained distrustful of his loyalty to Frodo, and treated him with disdain, and partially (though unintentionally) pushed Gollum to betray Frodo in [[Shelob's Lair]].<ref>{{L|165}}</ref><ref>{{L|96}}</ref>\nAs Sam, Frodo, and Gollum travelled, Sam began to worry about their food supplies running short and he, unlike Frodo, still thought of the return journey.<ref>{{TT|Passage}}</ref> In [[Ithilien]], he decided to risk a fire and stew rabbit, but he accidentally let it smoke which attracted the attention of [[Faramir]] and his rangers who were also in that region. There, to Sam's delight, he got the chance to see an [[oliphaunt]]. Faramir took the hobbits to [[Henneth Annûn]] where Sam accidentally revealed the purpose of their quest, but Faramir did not hinder it and Sam judged his quality to be \"the very highest.\", saying he reminded him of Gandalf.<ref>{{TT|Herbs}}; {{TT|Window}}</ref>\n\nGollum led the hobbits to the [[Stairs of Cirith Ungol]], where Sam, in a conversation with Frodo, reflected on whether their adventure would be put in tales and songs to be told by a fireside and noted that they were part of a greater tale than themselves.<ref name=\"TT|Stairs\">{{TT|Stairs}}</ref>\n[[File:Irvin Rodriguez - Samwise the Stouthearted.jpg|thumb|''Samwise the Stouthearted'' by [[:Category:Images by Irvin Rodriguez|Irvin Rodriguez]]]]\nGollum betrayed the hobbits in [[Shelob's lair]], hoping to find the Ring among Frodo's bones once [[Shelob]] had eaten him. However, Sam pierced Shelob's flesh, being the first person ever to have done so, but not before Shelob seemingly killed Frodo.\n\nGrieving for Frodo, Sam took the Ring. At first, he was tempted to go on a quest for revenge on Gollum but instead chose to complete the quest. However, upon learning that Frodo still lived, he rescued him from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and returned the Ring to him. Because he held the Ring for a time, he is considered one of the [[Ring-bearers]].<ref>{{TT|Choices}};{{RK|Tower}}</ref>\n\nTogether, Sam and Frodo crossed [[Mordor]] to [[Mount Doom]]. Sam himself carried Frodo up the slope for part of the way. There, Gollum tried to attack the hobbits and Sam spared his life now he had an idea of what it had been like for Gollum to be Ring-bearer—a choice which soon led to success in their quest. After the destruction of the Ring, both Sam and Frodo were honoured by [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] for their deeds.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}; {{RK|Field}}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Sam and Rosie Cotton.jpg|thumb|left|''Sam and Rosie Cotton'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nAfter the [[War of the Ring]], and the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful and beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of Galadriel's soil at the root of each. He was especially shocked that the [[Party Tree]] was cut down and planted a silver nut in the [[Party Field]] where it had once been, and the nut grew into the [[Golden Tree]], the only [[Mallorn]] tree in the Shire.\n\nHe married [[Rose Cotton|Rose \"Rosie\" Cotton]] on [[1 May]] {{SR|1420}}.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> In honor for restoring the Shire his family was given the name [[Gardner Family|Gardner]]. \n\nThey had thirteen children: [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor the Fair]], [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo]], [[Rose Gardner|Rose]], [[Merry Gardner|Merry]], [[Pippin Gardner|Pippin]], [[Goldilocks Gardner|Goldilocks]], [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]], [[Daisy Gardner|Daisy]], [[Primrose Gardner|Primrose]], [[Bilbo Gardner|Bilbo]], [[Ruby Gardner|Ruby]], [[Robin Gardner|Robin]], and [[Tolman Gardner|Tolman]]. When Frodo sailed on the [[White Ship]], at the end of the Third Age, Sam inherited Bag End and was entrusted the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].\n\nAfter [[Will Whitfoot]] resigned his post as [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] (the largest town in the Shire and the \"unofficial capital\"), in {{FoA|6}}, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire, that would be the first of seven consecutive 7-year terms.<ref name=later/> Soon after his election he established a rule of succession and inheritance in situations such as the headless [[Baggins family]], since Bilbo and Frodo went over the sea and was impossible to presume death.<ref>{{L|214}}</ref> During his service, King Elessar appointed the Mayor as a [[Counsellor of the North-kingdom]]. In {{SR|1436}} he met King Elessar on the [[Brandywine Bridge]] and was awarded the [[Star of the Dúnedain]]. In {{SR|1442}} he left [[Tolman Cotton Junior]] as deputy Mayor so that he rode to Gondor with his wife and his daughter Elanor, maid of honour to Queen Arwen, to spend a year there. When Elanor married [[Fastred of Greenholm]], he requested from Thain Peregrin to make him [[Warden of Westmarch]] in {{SR|1462}}.<ref name=later>{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\nAfter his wife died in {{FoA|61}}, on [[22 September]] Sam left Bag End, and went to the [[Tower Hills]] where he was last seen by Elanor, entrusting to her the Red Book; according to her, he went to the [[Grey Havens]] to sail across the Sea<ref name=later/> and be reunited with Frodo in the [[Undying Lands]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nSam has brown eyes. At some points his hands are described as brown.<ref name=\"TT|Stairs\"/><ref>{{RK|Tower}}</ref>\nThis could indicate he belongs to the [[Harfoots]], as they are described as having browner skin than the [[Fallohides]], to which breed Merry, Pippin and Frodo belong.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> Or it could simply be a tan from years of working outside. His face is often described as red-faced, turning scarlet or blushing. At one point his face is said to have turned white, before flushing scarlet.\n\nSam was a representative hobbit. He was vulgar and cocksure, but his devotion to Frodo moderated his conceit. For him, his service and loyalty was the measure of his heroicism and bravery.<ref>{{L|246}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samwise'' means \"simple minded\" or \"half-minded\". ''Gamgee'' is explained as a corruption of the name ''[[Gammidgy]]'', a village in the Shire. Both names are presented as translations of the [[Westron]] form of Sam's name '''[[Banazîr]] Galpsi''' (from the complete form [[Galbasi]]) (q.v. for more information).<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>\n\nTolkien's English translation, ''Samwís Gamwich'', could have come to ''Samwise Gamgee'' in modern English.\n\nThe [[Sindarin]] version of Samwise is '''''[[Perhael]]'''''. In the [[King's Letter]], contained in the unpublished \"[[Epilogue]]\", King Elessar refers to Sam as ''Perhael (i sennui Panthael estathar aen)'', Sindarin for \"Halfwise (who should rather be called Fullwise).\"\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] took the name from ''Gamgee Tissue'', a surgical dressing invented by a 19th century [[Birmingham]] surgeon called Joseph Sampson Gamgee. \"Gamgee\" became the colloquial name in Birmingham for cotton wool. Here, Tolkien describes why he had chosen that name for his character:\n{{blockquote|The choice of Gamgee was primarily directed by alliteration, but I did not invent it. It was caught out of childhood memory, as a comic word or name. It was in fact the name when I was small (in Birmingham) for 'cotton-wool'. (Hence the association of the Gamgees with the Cottons.) I knew nothing of its origin.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]:'' [[Letter 257]]}}\n\nIt is possible that Tolkien may have subconsciously recalled Dr. Gamgee (who died in 1886 but is commemorated by a plaque at the Birmingham Medical Institute, only yards from Tolkien's childhood home) but he claimed to be genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a letter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in ''The Lord of the Rings'' but had not read the book. Tolkien replied on March 18:\n{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Gamgee,<p>It was very kind of you to write. You can imagine my astonishment when I saw your signature! I can only say, for your comfort, I hope, that the 'Sam Gamgee' of my story is a most heroic character, now widely beloved by many readers, even though his origins are rustic. So that perhaps you will not be displeased at the coincidence of the name of this imaginary character of supposedly many centuries ago being the same as yours.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]:'' [[Letter 184]]}}\n\nHe proceeded to send Mr Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of the book. However, the incident sparked a nagging worry in Tolkien's mind, as he recorded in his journal: \n{{blockquote|For some time I lived in fear of receiving a letter signed 'S. Gollum'. That would have been more difficult to deal with.|''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''}}\n\n==Commentary==\nIn one of his letters, Tolkien described Sam is  as the \"chief hero\" and placed special emphasis on his \"rustic love\" for Rosie.<ref>{{L|131}}</ref> He was known for rescuing Frodo at [[Cirith Ungol]], and carrying him up [[Mount Doom]]. He was one of only two Ring-bearers strong enough to surrender the Ring voluntarily.\n\nThe relationship between Frodo and Sam is, in many respects, at the centre of ''The Lord of the Rings''.  Sam's humbleness and plain speaking are frequently emphasised in contrast to Frodo's gentility, and he often shows deference to Frodo, calling him \"Mister Frodo\" or \"Master\".  At the same time, a strong bond of love and trust grows between them, portrayed most poignantly during the events of Cirith Ungol, where Sam vows to return to his (apparently) dead master, to be reunited with Frodo in death. \n\n[[Tolkienists]] regard Sam as Frodo's ''[[wikipedia:Batman (army)|batman]]''. In the British Army, a batman was an orderly who acted as the personal servant of an officer. It was a role with which Tolkien (who served as an Army officer in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I First World War]) would have been extremely familiar. Sam undertakes all of the typical roles of a batman &mdash; he runs errands for Frodo, cooks, transports him (or at least carries him), and carries his luggage. Tolkien confirmed this interpretation when he wrote in a private letter that:\n{{blockquote|My Sam Gamgee is indeed a reflection of the English soldier, of the privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognized as so far superior to myself|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''}}\n\nThis may be compared to the relationship between [[wikipedia:Don Quixote|Don Quixote]] and his squire, [[wikipedia:Sancho Panza|Sancho Panza]], and the gradual \"Quixotization\" of Sancho.\n\n==In other stories==\nIn the illustrated short story ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', the local police officer is a Sergeant [[Boffin Family|Boffin]] who - at the behest of [[Gaffer Gamgee]] - seeks to lock up Mr Bliss as a thief for failing to pay for his car. Sergeant Boffin also has a son named Sam.<ref>[[J.R.R.

After Gandalf tells Frodo of the powers of [[The One Ring|Bilbo's ring]], Merry, Pippin and Sam decide to accompany Frodo to [[Rivendell]]. They set off, pursued by [[Nazgûl|Black Riders.]] Later, they encounter a group of dancing [[Elves]]. They camp with the Elves and share food, an experience which becomes, in Sam's memory, one of the chief events in his life. Continuing on, they arrive in the [[Old Forest]] and stop for a rest. Pippin is trapped in the [[Old Man Willow]] and Frodo and Sam attempt to help him out. Their efforts are futile until helped by a wandering [[Tom Bombadil]]. The group arrive at [[Bree]] and enter ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]''. They meet with a man named Strider. A letter from Gandalf reveals that his real name is [[Aragorn]] and the Hobbits follow him, as he knows a better route to Rivendell. They arrive in Rivendell and wait for Frodo, who is comatosed for 4 days due to his encounter with the Black Riders. The soon-to-be members of the [[Council of Elrond]] hold a celebratory feast after Frodo recovers. The Council convenes and they decide to form a [[Fellowship of the Ring]], comprising the previous members of their band, Gandalf, [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]], to take the ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it. As they prepare, Sam checks and re-checks his pack to ensure no supplies are missing. He is dismayed by the lack of rope, remembering that he had thought previously about how rope could be useful. The Fellowship depart and take a final look at the House of Elrond. The group sets off, Sam behind Frodo. \n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:[[Michael Scholes]] was the voice of Sam, and [[Billy Barty]] played him in rotoscoped footage. \n\n'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Sam is provided by [[Lou Bliss]].\n\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:[[Roddy McDowall]] provided the voice of Sam.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:A young [[Bill Nighy|William Nighy]] portrays Sam as a warm and caring person.

Dančiak, though a slightly older actor than the other actors portraying the four hobbits, was well-known for his convincing \"smart everyman\" roles. This is utilised in the series to emphasize that Sam comes from a more ordinary family and humbler social standing than Frodo, Pippin and Merry. Sam is portrayed as resourceful, honest, loyal, caring, and capable of finding bravery when he least expects it. He is also very curious about the world outside of The Shire, including Elven and Dwarven culture and lore. He is addressed almost entirely by his abbreviated name, Sam.\n\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Sam is played by [[Sean Astin]]. [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]] majorly diverges Sam and Frodo's story. Frodo, manipulated by Gollum and the One Ring, abandons Sam in Mordor after he offers to carry the Ring. Frodo faces Shelob alone and Sam comes to his rescue after he has already been bound by her webs. Though not noted in dialogue, a page of Frodo's ''The Lord of the Rings'' notes that Sam became the Mayor of Hobbiton.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:[[Scott Menville]] provided the voice for Sam in all but the X-box version; there, [[Cliff Broadway]] took over. The role of Sam is greatly diminished: after being caught eavesdropping by Gandalf, Sam is to be Frodo's companion, but he does not appear again until Frodo reaches [[Farmer Maggot]].\n\n'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Sam is a playable character in several missions: escape from [[Osgiliath]], Shelob's Lair, Cirith Ungol and the Crack of Doom. \n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Samwise only makes a single appearance in the Lothlorien mission.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:Unlike most other characters, Frodo and Sam make no appearance in Skirmish battles - they only appear in the storyline campaign.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Sam and other Hobbits are no longer permanent units, they are now a temporary power boost available to Free People forces.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Samwise is first found in Rivendell, preparing for the departure. Later, he is found on [[Cerin Amroth]] in Lothlorien, alongside Frodo. A series of a session plays depicts Sam, Frodo and Gollum's journey through the [[Dead Marshes]], the Pass of [[Cirith Ungol]] and [[Mordor]]. The player later meets Sam and Frodo again at the [[Field of Cormallen]].\n\n:The game's \"Guardian\" class (\"Tank\" in MMO terms) is based on Samwise due to the dedication he showed Frodo. Samwise insists that he is no Guardian and not fit to be one - because his heroic deeds have not happened yet. The player has to double-check and discovers that whoever talked of Sam as a great Guardian, apparently had misheard the word \"Gardener\".\n\n'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'':'''\n:Samwise appears in the game as a non-playable character, with [[Sean Astin]] reprising his role. He narrates the story of Aragorn to his children when the latter is to come to the Shire.\n\n{{References|n}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=hobbit\n| house=[[Gamgee Family]]\n| born=[[6 April]] {{TA|2980}}\n| died=Sailed west in {{FoA|61}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Frodo Baggins]]\n| list=[[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]]\n| dates=[[13 March|13]] - [[14 March]], {{TA|3019}}\n| next=[[Frodo Baggins]]\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Will Whitfoot]]\n| list=[[Mayor of Michel Delving]]\n| dates={{FoA|6}} - {{FoA|55|n}}\n| next=Unknown\n| nrow=2\n}}\n{{seq\n| pvac=None\n| prev=Position established\n| list=[[Counsellor of the North-kingdom]]\n| dates={{FoA|13}} - {{FoA|55|n}}\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{councilofelrond}}{{fellowship}}{{FellowshipRoute}}\n{{ringbearers}}{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Chroniclers of Arda]]\n[[Category:Fourth Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gamgee]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Michel Delving]]\n[[Category:Ring-bearers]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Samweis Gamdschie]]",

Startled, he got through the hedge and walked along the field inside, and watched as Bilbo reappeared, and put a [[The One Ring|glint of gold]] in his pocket. This made teenage Meriadoc very curious and he even looked into Bilbo's [[There and Back Again|private diary]].<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" />\n\nMerry kept this knowledge private but was always suspicious.

Especially after [[April]] {{TA|3018}} he noticed how Frodo was saying \"farewell\" to his favourite places, selling [[Bag End]] to the [[Sackville-Bagginses]], and secretive talks with [[Gandalf]].

However, when they encountered [[Old Man Willow]] Merry (and Pippin) were both captured and had to be rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref>  Merry and Pippin were captured again (along with Sam and Frodo) by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] upon the [[Barrow-downs]], but Tom again came to their rescue. Before leaving, he told them to keep the [[Daggers of Westernesse]] found in the Barrow Downs, and he advised them to spend the night at the [[The Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]], inside [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I8}}</ref> \n[[File:John Howe - Weathertop on the Horizon.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Howe]] - ''Weathertop on the Horizon'']]\nUpon reaching the inn, Merry was out for a walk and saw a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]]. He tried to follow it, but it disappeared. Merry was then overtaken by the [[Black Breath]] and fainted. But before any harm could come to him, [[Nob]] came to his aid; he returned to the Prancing Pony and warned his companions who were talking with [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]].<ref name=\"Strider\">{{FR|I10}}</ref>  During the trip through the wild with Strider, he often saw the most deeply into the others.  After Frodo was wounded on [[Weathertop]], he became the one who consulted most with Strider, and in a way became the spokesman for the Hobbits.\n\nAfter reaching [[Rivendell]], he, with Pippin, insisted on not being left behind on the [[Quest of the Ring]].  Therefore they were chosen as the eighth and ninth members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>\n\nAt the gate of [[Moria]], [[Gandalf]] commended Merry for being \"''of all people''\" on the right track with the riddle (though this was accidental).  His impetuosity in Moria was such that he nearly fell into an ancient well while running ahead with Pippin.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>  When they reached [[Lothlórien]], he was allowed to sleep in a [[telain]] with Frodo, Sam, Pippin and a few elven guards. He, as with the rest of the Company, walked blindfolded into the Woods of Lórien in a show of support for [[Gimli]], who had to be blindfolded due to being a [[Dwarves|dwarf]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Plains of Rohan 2.jpg|thumb|\"The Plains of Rohan\" by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nAt the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], Merry and Pippin ran straight into a company of [[Orcs]] while they were looking for Frodo.  [[Boromir]] attempted to rescue them, but many [[Uruk-hai]] arrived, and they shot him with arrows.  Captured with Pippin by Uruk-hai, the two were separated from the rest of the Fellowship.  Merry aided Pippin in an attempt to deceive [[Grishnákh]] into thinking that they had the One Ring, and he could have it.<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref>  Because of this, they escaped into [[Fangorn Forest]] during the attack by [[Éomer]] and his [[Rohirrim|Outriders]]. There they met [[Treebeard]].  \n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Wellinghall'']]\n[[File:Zina Saunders - Flotsam and Jetsam.jpg|thumb|Zina Saunders - ''Flotsam and Jetsam'']]\nThus they became the first mortals for many centuries to encounter the [[Ents]] of Fangorn. They drank of the [[Ent-draughts|Ent-draught]] which caused Merry and Pippin to become the tallest hobbits in history. Also, they were present at the [[Entmoot]],<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref> and the resulting destruction of [[Isengard]], after which Treebeard appointed them door-wardens of [[Orthanc]]. It was while they were enjoying [[Saruman]]'s [[pipe-weed]], that they were reunited with some of their former companions, who arrived after the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>\n\n===Esquire of Théoden===\nWhile Pippin and Gandalf headed away to [[Minas Tirith]], Merry stayed with Aragorn and the Rohirrim, developing a close friendship with King [[Théoden]].  Out of love for him, Merry offered the King his service, which Théoden warmly accepted.  \"''As a father you shall be to me''\", Merry said at that time, and Théoden responded \"''For a little while''\".<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>\n\nAs Théoden's esquire, Merry returned with him to [[Edoras]] and was forbidden - firmly but gently - by the King to ride with them to the aid of Minas Tirith because he could not ride the mighty horses of the Rohirrim so fast and so far.  Merry was disappointed until a young rider named [[Dernhelm]] offered to bear him on his horse.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>  In this manner he rode to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], having a secret understanding with [[Elfhelm]] and several others of the Rohirrim.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>\n[[File:Angus McBride - Eowyn against Witch-king.gif|thumb|left|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Éowyn against Witch-king'']]\nDuring the charge and the commencement of the battle he was almost useless, hiding behind Dernhelm and shaking with fright and nausea.  However, Dernhelm's steed, [[Windfola]], threw them both upon the coming of the [[Witch-king]].  Affected by the Black Breath, Merry lay almost senseless on the ground, hearing the voice of Dernhelm standing over the body of Théoden—who had been mortally wounded by the Witch-king—defying the Nazgûl.  He was startled as he opened his eyes to find that Dernhelm was really [[Éowyn]], the King's niece.  After Éowyn was thrown down, perhaps mortally wounded, Merry rose to attack the Witch-king in order to protect her.  He pierced the sinew behind the Witch-king's mighty knee with the [[Daggers of Westernesse|Barrow-blade]] he still bore, thus breaking the spell of invulnerability surrounding the Wraith.  He witnessed Éowyn's destruction of the Witch-king with a thrust into the head, and her subsequent collapse.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref> After the death of the Witch-king, he begged forgiveness of a dying Théoden for disobeying his command to remain at Edoras, and the king forgave him with the words \"''Great heart will not be denied.''\" After the death of the king, he walked beside Théoden's pall-bearers, and fell into a stupor induced by the [[Black Breath]] at some point in his journey.<ref name=\"Houses\">{{RK|V8}}</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, Pippin found him ill and wandering in a daze outside of [[Minas Tirith]] and alerted Aragorn, who brought him into the city. Almost killed by the Black Breath, Merry and Éowyn were revived by Aragorn in the [[Houses of Healing]].<ref name=\"Houses\" />  Because of his condition he was unable to take part in the [[Battle of the Morannon]],<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref> but afterwards attended the burial of [[Théoden]], at which he wept greatly.  Upon his departure for the Shire, he was given a special horn by Éomer and Éowyn as a parting gift, which was later used in the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>\n\nUpon the return to the Shire, he was, with Pippin, the primary leader of the uprising against [[Sharkey]] and his [[Ruffians]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n===After the war===\nAt some time he stayed with Pippin at Crickhollow<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> and he married the sister of his friend Fredegar, [[Estella Brandybuck|Estella]].\n\nHe was afterwards known as '''Meriadoc the Magnificent''', and became [[Master of Buckland]] after his father, and received great gifts from his friends King Éomer and Lady Éowyn.<ref name=\"later\">{{App|Later}}</ref> He wrote several scholarly works which were probably part of the [[Red Book]]: ''[[Herblore of the Shire]]'', ''The [[Reckoning of Years]]'' and ''[[Old Words and Names in the Shire]]''.

They both were laid in [[Rath Dínen]].  It was said that upon [[Aragorn|King Elessar]]'s death, their bodies were placed beside his.<ref name=\"later\" />\n\n==Character==\n[[File:Nia Kovaleski - Merry and Pippin.jpeg|thumb|right|''Merry and Pippin'' by [[:Category:Images by Nia Kovalevski|Nia Kovaleski]]]]He was a good friend of [[Frodo Baggins]], who eventually became the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], and [[Peregrin Took]], a young relative.  He was one of the few (if any) who saw [[Bilbo Baggins]], Frodo's uncle, actually use [[the One Ring]].  He also managed to read, at least in part, Bilbo's book: ''[[There and Back Again]]'', where he learned about the Ring.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" />\n\nHe can easily be recognised as a very sharp Hobbit, and his tone throughout ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' depicts him as practical, loyal, resourceful, and the best able to cope with the sudden happenings that drew him out of his peaceful home.  He was also praised by [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] as having a 'stout heart'<ref name=\"Strider\" /> and [[Éowyn|Lady Éowyn]] as 'valiant'.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>  He was apparently much trusted by Frodo, who sent him along with [[Fredegar Bolger|Fatty Bolger]] to [[Crickhollow]] to prepare his newly-bought home.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name '''''Meriadoc''''' means \"Great Lord\" in [[Welsh]] (from ''mawr'' \"great\" and ''udd'' \"lord\").<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.namenerds.com/welsh/meaning.html|articlename=Welsh Names|website=[http://www.namenerds.com/ Name Nerds]|accessed=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nMerry's full [[Westron]] name was ''Kalimac'', which was abbreviated to ''Kali''.

He was the youngest of the four Hobbits in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], being in his tweens, but grew up quickly and eventually became a Knight of Gondor. [[Elrond]], at least, seemed to doubt his capability for the quest, but Pippin proved to be a loyal and courageous friend.\n\nAfter the [[War of the Ring]], Peregrin eventually inherited the [[Thain]]ship in [[the Shire]] after his father's death.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHe was born in the [[Third Age]] [[Third Age 2990|2990]] (1390 in [[Shire Reckoning]]) to [[Paladin Took II|Paladin Took]] and [[Eglantine Banks]], making him a great-great-grandson of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]]. Pippin became Thain in later years, and his father inherited the title in S.R. 1415 from [[Ferumbras Took III]] when he died without an heir. Pippin had three older sisters, [[Pearl Took]], [[Pimpernel Took]], and [[Pervinca Took]].<ref name=\"Took\">{{App|Took}}</ref>\n\nThrough his father, Pippin was a first cousin of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] (the future [[Master of Buckland]]), the second cousin once removed of [[Frodo Baggins]], and the first cousin twice removed of [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He was not blood-related to [[Samwise Gamgee]], but Pippin's son [[Faramir Took I|Faramir]] married Sam's daughter [[Goldilocks Gardner]] in 1463.\n\n==History==\nWhen he was young he was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] with his family. As his uncle the [[Thain]] [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras]] was childless, Pippin's father, Paladin, became the Thain.<ref name=\"Took\" /> Pippin's closest friends were his cousins, [[Merry Brandybuck]] and Frodo<ref name=\"shadow\">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> (all descendants of the Old Took). Pippin and Merry often wandered at the [[Marish]] and used to visit [[Farmer Maggot]]; he knew the lands around the Marish and enjoyed the beer of the ''[[Golden Perch]]'' at [[Stock]].<ref name=\"short\">{{FR|I4}}</ref>\n\nHe was one of the [[Conspirators]], who knew the truth behind Frodo's mysterious behaviour and reasons for departure of the Shire. Along with Merry, [[Fredegar Bolger]] and [[Folco Boffin]] they helped Frodo pack his household and send carts to [[Crickhollow]]; they celebrated together his last [[22 September|birthday]] in [[Bag End]], and stayed with Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] when the others left for [[Buckland]].\n\n===Travels with Frodo===\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Three is Company.jpg|thumb|left|''Three is Company'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nThe [[23 September|next day]] he accompanied Frodo and Sam to [[Bucklebury]]. During the first days of the travel, Pippin was he who complained first for being tired, sleepy or hungry. The [[24 September|next day]] they encountered [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] who were turned away by a [[Wandering Companies|company]] of [[High Elves]] led by [[Gildor]], and Pippin greeted them expressing his respect. During their camp he felt he was in a dream, enchanted by the [[Light of Valinor|light]] of their faces and their beautiful voices. Once he fell asleep, the Elves moved and laid him to a soft bed at a bower under the trees.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>\n\nThe [[25 September|other morning]] he woke up first and wanted to finish off the elven bread if not for Sam's insistence to leave some for him and Frodo. When Frodo woke up they had an argument as Frodo wanted to cut through Marish to avoid any Black Riders, and Pippin regretted for not stopping at Stock.<ref name=\"short\" />\n\nIn Buckland, they joined Merry and Fatty. It was there that Frodo learned about his friends' \"conspiracy\" and that they did not intend to let him leave [[The Shire]] without them. They left the Shire to meet [[Gandalf]] in [[Bree]]. Pippin's enthusiasm to accompany Frodo is the result of his adventurous 'Tookish' nature as well as his loyalty and friendship to his cousin.\n\nThe stuffiness and eeriness of [[The Old Forest]] made Pippin the most uncomfortable of the four [[Hobbits]] with him becoming more and more suspicious of the intentions of the Forest; Pippin was, however, right to be suspicious as he was trapped by [[Old Man Willow]] before being rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]]. On the way to [[Bree]], from Tom Bombadil's house, Pippin again fell into misfortune as he was trapped by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] on the [[Barrow-downs]]. \n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight'']]\nWhilst at [[The Prancing Pony]] Pippin began to recklessly tell the story of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s birthday and subsequent disappearance. In order to prevent information about the Ring being revealed, Frodo started to sing - during the song Frodo fell from the table and the Ring slipped upon his finger. As a result, The Prancing Pony was attacked by the [[Nazgûl]] during the night, but the four Hobbits were unharmed thanks to the mysterious [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]], [[Aragorn|Strider]].\n\n===Fellowship of the Ring===\nWhen Pippin finally arrived at [[Rivendell]] he was concerned that he and Merry would be left behind whilst both Sam and Frodo get to go on the [[Quest of the Ring|Quest]]. However, his indignant attitude paid off as [[Gandalf]] believed that the friendship between Pippin and the other Hobbits would be beneficial to the Quest.\n\nWhen in [[Moria]], Pippin incurred the wrath of Gandalf on two separate occasions: Pippin annoyed Gandalf with a foolish question while Gandalf was trying to open the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]]; and, when inside the [[Well-chamber]] in Moria,<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]], p. 40</ref> Pippin's curiosity got the better of him as he dropped a stone down a well which lead to the [[Fellowship of the Ring|the Fellowship]] hearing the drums in the deep - in doing so Pippin gained the retort, \"''Fool of a Took!''\" from Gandalf.\n\n===With Treebeard===\nDuring the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], [[Boromir]] died defending Merry and Pippin from capture by the [[Uruk-hai]] who were taking the Hobbits back to [[Saruman]] at [[Isengard]] on the mistaken belief that one of them had [[The One Ring|the Ring]]. On the journey to Isengard, Pippin displayed intelligence and resourcefulness by cutting his own bonds and leaving his [[Elven brooches|Elven brooch]] from [[Lothlórien]] on the ground for Aragorn to find.\n\nWhilst held captive, Merry and Pippin became aware that the [[Orcs|Orc]] [[Grishnákh]] had guessed that they might have the Ring, so they used Grishnákh's greed to untie them and take them away from the other Orcs. When the [[Rohirrim]] attacked the Uruk-hai, Grishnákh was killed by a spear and Merry and Pippin were able to escape into [[Fangorn Forest]] where they encountered [[Treebeard]] and the other [[Ents]].\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Wellinghall'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nMerry and Pippin struck up a friendship with Treebeard, telling him about all that had happened on their journey, whilst Treebeard told the two hobbits about the loss of the [[Entwives]](and much more besides). Treebeard decided to call an [[Entmoot]] at [[Derndingle]] to decide the Ents' next move. While the Entmoot was going on, Pippin and Merry were left in the care of a 'hasty' Ent named [[Quickbeam]] who had already decided to go to battle with the Orcs as many of his tree friends had been killed.\n[[File:Peter Pracownik - Six of Cups (LOTR).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and Pippin relax and joke after the fall of [[Orthanc]] - Art by [[Peter Pracownik]]]]\nMerry and Pippin [[Ents#The March of the Ents|marched with the Ents]] to Isengard where the Ents killed the remaining servants of Saruman, filled the [[Ring of Isengard]] with water, and kept Saruman hostage in [[Orthanc]]. Whilst sitting on their \"field of victory\", Merry and Pippin were reunited with Aragorn, [[Gandalf]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] with whom they shared some [[pipe-weed]] and a meal. \n\nFollowing Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, [[Gríma]] threw the [[Orthanc-stone|palantír of Isengard]] out of the window at Gandalf which Pippin subsequently picked up. After Gandalf took it from him, Pippin remained curious about it, and later remarked to Merry about how he would like to look at it again. Unable to sleep, Pippin was finally overcome by curiosity. He stole the palantír from Gandalf's keeping while he slept, but when he looked into it, he was seen by [[Sauron]] who mistakenly believed that Pippin and the Ring were with Saruman in Isengard. After a Nazgûl flew by on its [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]], Gandalf realised that war was coming soon, and he rode immediately for [[Minas Tirith]], taking Pippin with him for safe keeping.\n\n===Guard of the Citadel===\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Pippin Comforts Merry.jpeg|thumb|right|''Pippin Comforts Merry'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nUpon arriving in Minas Tirith, Pippin went with Gandalf to the [[Citadel of Gondor|Citadel]] and recounted Boromir's death to [[Denethor]], who was Boromir's father as well as the [[Ruling Steward]]. In return for Boromir's untimely death, Pippin decided to pledge his allegiance to the grieving [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] and so became a [[Guards of the Citadel|Guard of the Citadel]]. Pippin befriended [[Beregond]], of the [[Third Company of the Citadel]], who showed him 'round the city and told him the secret passwords and ways of the city, and became good friends with Beregond's son [[Bergil]].\n\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Pyre of Denethor.jpeg|thumb|left|''The Pyre of Denethor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nDenethor was amused with the Hobbit's manners, especially the way he spoke to him in a very informal and personalized familiar language, as with a close friend or social equal, since the [[Hobbitish|Hobbit-speech]] lacked formal forms. Denethor's servants were astonished to this view, and probably gave strength to the rumor that Pippin was of very high social rank within his own country, and soon a wild rumor circulated, that the \"[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]\" had promised 5,000 Hobbits to the defence of the city.\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Gondor]], Pippin was instrumental in saving [[Faramir]]'s life. After Faramir had returned from battle, he was badly wounded and suffering from the [[Black Breath]]; [[Denethor]] looked into the [[Anor-stone|palantír of Minas Tirith]] and saw the full might of [[Mordor]]. Believing that Sauron's forces would prevail in battle, Denethor ordered his servants to set a pyre so both he and Faramir could burn alive, but Pippin was able to fetch Gandalf and Beregond who were both able to help save Faramir.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Pippin found [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] all in a daze - due to Merry's confrontation with the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] - and took him to the [[Houses of Healing]] where he was healed by [[Aragorn]]. Pippin accompanied the forces of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] to the [[Black Gate]] where he participated in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], and saved Beregond's life by slaying a [[Hill-trolls|hill-troll]]. Pippin was crushed beneath the troll, but he was pulled out by [[Gimli]] who recognized his foot.\n\n===Return to the Shire===\nWhen Pippin and the other Hobbits returned to The Shire, they were enraged to see what had happened to their peaceful corner of the world. Pippin went off to [[Tookland]] to raise up the [[Took Family|Took]]s in rebellion, and when he returned for the [[Battle of Bywater]] he brought 100 strong hobbits with him. Pippin and Merry jointly commanded the Hobbit victory and their names were placed at the top of [[The Roll]] commemorating those who fought in the battle.<ref name=\"Scouring\">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Pippin and Diamond.jpg|thumb|left|Pippin meets his future wife.]]\nPippin and Merry were heroes, and would tell all the other hobbits the stories of their travels to far-off lands. They would often go out abroad wearing their armour (Pippin had remained a Knight of Gondor) and people thought they were lordly - a position likely enforced by their extraordinary height caused by the [[Ent-draughts]] (they were at least 4'5<nowiki>''</nowiki> tall - taller than [[Bandobras Took|Bullroarer Took]]).<ref name=\"Concerning\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\nIn {{SR|1427}} (at the age of 37), he married [[Diamond of Long Cleeve]], and they had a child together, [[Faramir Took I|Faramir]], [[Fourth Age 9|three years later]].<ref name=\"later\" /> \n===Thainship===\n[[File:Gregor Roffalski - Thain Peregrin I.jpg|thumb|''Thain Peregrin I'' by Gregor Roffalski]]\nIn {{SR|1434}} (at the age of 44) Pippin succeeded his father [[Paladin Took II|Paladin]] by becoming the 32nd [[Thain|Thain of the Shire]], and was also made a Counsellor of the North-kingdom by King Elessar.<ref name=\"later\" />\n\nIn {{SR|1436}} King Elessar rode north and met Pippin, Merry and Sam at the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. In {{SR|1452}} the King, as a gift, added the [[Westmarch]] to The Shire, and in {{SR|1462}} at Sam's request Pippin appointed [[Fastred of Greenholm|Fastred]] - son-in-law of Sam - as the first [[Warden of Westmarch]].<ref name=\"later\" />\n\nAs Thain, Pippin collected a library of historical information at [[Great Smials]], especially information relating to [[Númenor]] and the heirs of [[Elendil]]. It was at Great Smials that ''[[Appendix B|The Tale of Years]]'' was likely put together, with assistance from Merry, although Pippin himself probably didn't write any works. His successors expanded the collection.<ref name=\"Records\">{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\nIn {{SR|1484}}, at the age of 94 and having been Thain for 50 years, Pippin and Merry passed on their possessions and offices to their sons and left [[The Shire]] to visit [[Rohan]] where they stayed with [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Éomer]] for his last days. Then they moved to [[Gondor]] where they spent their last few years. Their bodies were placed in [[Rath Dínen]]; they were later laid beside King [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] following his death in {{FoA|120}} ({{SR|1541}}).<ref name=\"later\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n'''Peregrin''' is a translation of Pippin's [[Hobbitish]] name ''Razanur'', which was the name of a legendary traveller. It probably contains the [[Westron]] elements ''razan'' (\"stranger\"), ''raza'' (\"foreign\"), which is why [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] chose ''Peregrin'' to represent ''Razanur''.<ref name=\"PM\">{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, On Translation, $49</ref> When Peregrin Took became Thain he was registered as '''Thain Peregrin I'''.<ref name=\"Took\" />\n\nThe name ''[[wikipedia:Peregrine (name)|Peregrin]]'' is derived from Latin ''peregrinus'', which means \"foreign\". The term was used for a person who wandered abroad. The English word ''pilgrim'' is derived from the same root.<ref name=\"Jim Allen\">{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 192</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n*'''[[wikipedia:Pippin (name)|Pippin]]''' is a 'pet-form' of ''Peregrin'' related to the Westron abbreviation ''[[Razar]]'' which is a type of small red [[apples|apple]].<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n*'''[[Razanur Tûk]]''' - Peregrin's true [[Westron]] name.<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n*\"''Fool of a Took''\" and \"''Tom-fool of a Took''\" - given to him by [[Gandalf]] for his often mischievous behaviour, and, in particular, for dropping a stone down the well in [[Moria]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>\n*''[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]'' - [[Sindarin]] for \"Prince of the Halflings\", an erroneous title given to Pippin by the people of [[Minas Tirith]] on the belief he must be of high importance to be travelling with Gandalf.<ref name=\"Minas\">{{RK|V1}}</ref>\n*[[Guards of the Citadel|Guard of the Citadel]] - the office Pippin held when he swore fealty to [[Denethor]].<ref name=\"Minas\" />\n*Knight of Gondor - a position which Aragorn confirmed Pippin held;<ref name=\"Partings\">{{RK|Partings}}</ref> it is unclear whether being a Guard of the Citadel equates to being a Knight or if Aragorn elevated him to that position.\n*[[Counsellor of the North-kingdom]] - a position granted to Pippin when he became Thain.<ref name=\"later\" />\n\n:''See also: [[Took Family]] for information on Pippin's surname.''\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | OLD |y| CHU | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |OLD=[[Gerontius Took|The Old Took]]<br/><small>''1190 - 1320''</small>|CHU=[[Adamanta Chubb]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | HIL |y| ROS | | NCH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |ROS=[[Rosa Baggins]]<br/><small>''1256 - unknown''</small>|HIL=[[Hildigrim Took|Hildigrim]]<br/><small>''1240 - 1341''</small>|NCH=<small>''numerous children''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | ADA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |ADA=[[Adalgrim Took|Adalgrim]]<br/><small>''1280 - 1382''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | PAL |y| EGL | | | DAU | | | | | | | SAR |y| ESM |PAL=[[Paladin Took II|Paladin II]]<br/><small>''1333 - 1434''</small>|EGL=[[Eglantine Banks]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>|DAU=<small>''3 daughters''</small>|ESM=[[Esmeralda Took|Esmeralda]]<br/><small>''1336 - unknown''</small>|SAR=[[Saradoc Brandybuck]]<br/><small>''1340 - 1432''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | PEA | | PIM | | PER | | PIP |y| DIA | | MER | | |PEA=[[Pearl Took|Pearl]]<br/><small>''1375 - unknown''</small>|PIM=[[Pimpernel Took|Pimpernel]]<br/><small>''1379 - unknown''</small>|PER=[[Pervinca Took|Pervinca]]<br/><small>''1385 - unknown''</small>|PIP='''PEREGRIN I'''<br/><small>''1390 - 1484+''</small>|DIA=[[Diamond of Long Cleeve|Diamond]]<br/><small>''1395 - unknown''</small>|MER=[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]]<br/><small>''1382 - 1484+''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | GOL |~| FAR | | | | | | | | |GOL=[[Goldilocks Gardner|Goldilocks]]<br/><small>''1431 - unknown''</small>|FAR=[[Faramir Took I|Faramir I]]<br/><small>''1430 - unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the earliest drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (see ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''), Frodo's counterpart Bingo Baggins was accompanied by his Took nephews, Frodo and Odo. They were similar characters but Odo was more limited and unaware than Frodo (Took) while Frodo was \"more susceptible to the beauty and otherness of the Elves\". Christopher Tolkien speculates that some aspects of Frodo Took have been preserved in Samwise Gamgee. Through a process that [[Christopher Tolkien]] described as \"strangely torturous\" these characters were gradually folded into the singular character of Peregrin Took.<ref>{{RS|1IIU}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Pippin in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Sagan om Ringen - Pippin.png|Pippin in [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'']]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Pippin.jpg|Pippin in [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Return of the King (1980 film) - Pippin.jpg|Pippin in [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Pippin.jpg|[[Billy Boyd]] as Pippin in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Peregrin Took.jpg|Pippin in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:[[Basil Jones]] provided the voice of Pippin.\n\n'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''\n:After [[Gandalf]] encourages [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] to take [[The One Ring]] to [[Rivendell]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and Pippin decide they will accompany him. The [[Hobbits]] cross the main country road from [[Michel Delving]] to [[Bywater]] and go east through [[Green Hill Country]]. They flee the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] on the road to [[Woodhall]], and the [[Bucklebury Ferry]]. They hide from the Riders and, after they leave, watch a group of dancing [[Elves]]. They camp with the Elves and eat food. The Hobbits decide to avoid all roads and take the path through the [[Old Forest]]. When camping for the night, they discover that Pippin has been completely swallowed by the [[Old Man Willow]] and Merry’s legs are sticking out. Frodo finds it impossible to set them free until helped by [[Tom Bombadil]]. Tom sings, which loosens the Tree, and pulls Merry and then Pippin out of the tree. The Hobbits continue on to [[Bree]] and meet Strider at the ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]]''. After a letter from Gandalf tells that his true name is [[Aragorn]] and that he is to be trusted, the Hobbits join him on the way to Rivendell. Frodo is attacked by Black Riders on the way and [[Glorfindel]] heals him, though he is still injured, and gifts him his horse [[Asfaloth]]. The Hobbits arrive at Rivendell and Frodo awakens from his coma four days later. The Hobbits and the others in Rivendell hold a lively feast in celebration. The [[Council of Elrond]] convenes and they decide to take the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it in the fire where it was created. A [[Fellowship of the Ring]] is formed, comrpising The Hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]]. Pippin departs third last, behind Merry and before Gimli.

Boromir's temperament was similar to King [[Eärnur]] of old; he took no wife and was more interested in arms and warfare. He cared little for lore, save for the tales of old battles.<ref name=\"stew\" /> Boromir was a man of great strength and valour. He had a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.<ref name=\"Council\" />\n\nHe was one of the nine members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]],<ref name=\"Council\" /> until his death at the hands of the [[Uruk-hai]] which led to the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]]<ref name=\"Breaking\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Catherine Chmiel - The Gift 1.jpg|thumb|left|Boromir and baby Faramir, art by [[Catherine Chmiel]]]]\nBoromir was born in {{TA|2978}}, five years before his brother Faramir.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2978 and entry for the year 2983 of the Third Age</ref> Between the brothers there was great love, and had been since childhood, when Boromir was the helper and protector of Faramir. He was only ten years old when their mother Finduilas died,<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2988 \"Finduilas dies young.\"</ref> and after her death their father became more grim and silent than before.<ref name=\"stew\" />\n\nBoromir grew to be a valorous warrior, interested in arms, warfare and tales of old battles and would serve as a commander to the military of Gondor.<ref name=\"stew\" />\n\nOn the evening before Sauron's [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|attack on Osgiliath]], Faramir repeatedly had a dream. A similar dream came to Boromir once. Both Boromir and Faramir could understand little of these words; therefore, they spoke to their father who was wise in the lore of [[Gondor]]. But even he could only say that [[Rivendell]], which is also known as Imladris, was a dale in the far north where the [[Half-elven]] Lord [[Elrond]] lived.<ref name=\"Council\" />{{rp|320–1}}\n\nAnother day, when [[Sauron]] [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|attacked]] [[Osgiliath]] at the dawn of the [[War of the Ring]], Boromir was a commander. His company drove back the [[Orcs]] and held the last bridge; eventually they destroyed it behind them, to prevent the Orcs from crossing the river.<ref name=\"Council\" />\n\n===Journey to Rivendell===\n{{quote|In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered, and out of it I heard a voice, remote but clear, crying:<br>\nSeek for the Sword that was broken:<br>\nIn Imladris it dwells;<br>\nThere shall be counsels taken<br>\nStronger than Morgul-spells.<br>\nThere shall be shown a token<br>\nThat Doom is near at hand,<br>\nFor Isildur's Bane shall waken,<br>\nAnd the Halfling forth shall stand.|Boromir telling [[Seek for the Sword that was broken|his dream]]<ref name=Council/>}}\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Boromir sets out.jpg|thumb|''Boromir sets out'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nRegarding the brothers' earlier dream, Faramir was eager to seek Imladris. However, the way was full of doubt and danger, so out of protection for his brother Boromir took the journey upon himself.<ref name=\"Council\" />{{rp|321}}\n\nBoromir's journey took 110 days.<ref name=\"Council\" />{{rp|320}} He passed through the [[Gap of Rohan]] and travelled north through the lands west of the Misty Mountains. He faced many hardships, for that land had fallen into decay and the [[North-South Road]] no longer existed except for crumbling remains of the old causeways.<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> Near [[Tharbad]] he crossed the [[Gwathló|Greyflood]] using a dangerous ford formed by a ruined bridge and he lost his [[horses|horse]]<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}, p. 487</ref>, which returned home to Rohan.<ref name=\"Riders\">{{TT|Riders}}</ref> The rest of the way he travelled on foot.   \n\nWhen he reached [[Rivendell]], he attended the [[Council of Elrond]]. Representatives from races and lands of the [[Westlands]] spoke about the current situations, and Boromir spoke about the [[Council of Gondor]]'s vigilance and the struggle to keep the forces of [[Mordor]] from crossing the [[Anduin]]. However, he said, he had not come seeking military aid but counsel. When he told of the dream that had led him to Rivendell the answers to its riddles were revealed: [[Aragorn]] brought out the [[Shards of Narsil]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] the [[Halflings|Halfling]] held up [[the One Ring]] that was [[Isildur]]'s Bane. There he attempted to persuade the Council to let him take the One Ring to Gondor so that it could be used in the defence of the realm. Elrond explained, however, that the Ring could not be used by anyone other than [[Sauron]]. For even though one might use it for the purpose of doing good, it would twist all deeds and intentions to evil in the end.<ref name=\"Council\" />\n\n===Fellowship of the Ring===\nIt was Boromir's intention to return to [[Minas Tirith]], which is why he joined the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. When the Company of the Ring reached [[Caradhras]], Boromir advised that each of them should carry a faggot of wood.<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 374</ref> This saved the Company from freezing to death when they got caught in a blizzard on Caradhras. The next morning Boromir and Aragorn ploughed their way through the snow and carried the four [[Hobbits]] back down the mountain to safety.<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 381</ref>\n\nAs the [[Redhorn Pass]] was now blocked, Boromir proposed that they should travel southward on the west side of the [[Misty Mountains]] and then either pass through the Gap of Rohan or cross the [[Isen]] and go through the southern lands of [[Anfalas|Langstrand]] and [[Lebennin]]. But [[Gandalf]] opposed this saying that, because of [[Saruman]]'s treachery those lands were no longer safe. He proposed that the Company should instead go through the mines of [[Moria]], but Boromir said that he would not go that way, not unless the whole company voted against him.<ref name=\"Journey\">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>\n\nBoromir finally agreed, but upon reaching the [[Doors of Durin]] he was angry that [[Gandalf]] did not know the password and he threw a stone into the Dark Water. This alerted the [[Watcher in the Water]]. When Gandalf stepped into the mines the Watcher attacked Frodo, but all the Company were able to escape into the mines.<ref name=\"Journey\" />\n\nBoromir fought valiantly when the Company was attacked in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], and he blocked the western door and hewed at the arm of a [[Cave-trolls|Cave-troll]]. After escaping from the Chamber, the company reached the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] they were again attacked by Orcs, and with them was a [[Balrogs|Balrog]]. Boromir sounded his [[Great Horn]] which prompted the [[Orcs]] to pause, uneasy. But when they heard no answer, nor saw reinforcements, they led a second onslaught. As Gandalf fought with the Balrog, Boromir and Aragorn ran towards him, but just as they reached the crossing Gandalf shattered the bridge and the Balrog fell into the abyss, dragging Gandalf in as well.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n\nAragorn then led the Company towards [[Lothlórien]]. Boromir advised against this, saying that the woods had a perilous reputation in Gondor and that few escaped unscathed. Aragorn replied that only those who were evil or brought evil with them had reason to fear Lothlórien. After [[Galadriel]] had spoken to each member of the Company in their thoughts, Boromir was keen to know about the conversation between the Lady and the Ring-bearer, but what he thought that the Lady had offered him he would not tell. When the Company were set to depart from Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each of them a gift. Boromir received a [[Boromir's belt|golden Belt]].<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>\n[[File:John Howe - Good Sense Revolts.jpg|thumb|left|''Good Sense Revolts'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nAs the Company set out down the [[Anduin]], Boromir shared a boat with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. As they travelled down the river, Boromir became increasingly consumed with thoughts of the Ring. He muttered to himself and bit his nails and sometimes paddled closer to Frodo's boat. His behaviour made Merry and Pippin uneasy, and Pippin noticed a strange glint in Boromir's eye as he looked at Frodo. As the Company approached the rapids of [[Sarn Gebir]] it was Boromir who alerted them and they were able to turn back. Boromir then advised the company to leave the river and strike a westward and southward road to Gondor. But Frodo did not intend to go to Gondor, hence the Company continued on their way down the river.<ref>{{FR|River}}</ref>\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Boromir's Last Stand.jpg|thumb|right|''Boromir's Last Stand'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n===Breaking of the Fellowship===\nWhen the Company reached [[Nen Hithoel]], it was time for the Company to decide their next course. When Frodo wandered off into the forest to think, Boromir followed him after a while. He tried to persuade Frodo to bring [[The One Ring|The Ring]] to Minas Tirith. As Boromir spoke, the lure of the Ring grew stronger in him. He envisioned himself as a mighty king who would overthrow Sauron, rescue his people beyond hope, and lead Gondor to victory and glory. When Frodo refused to accompany him to Minas Tirith, Boromir became enraged and stressed and tried to take the Ring from Frodo by force. Frodo put the Ring on and vanished. When [[Frodo]] had gone, Boromir was overwhelmed with the realization of what he had done. He wept and called for Frodo to return, but it was too late.<ref name=\"Breaking\">{{FR|Breaking}}</ref>\n\nWhen Boromir returned to the Company he would only say that he had argued with Frodo and that the hobbit had disappeared. Merry and Pippin ran off looking for their friend, and Aragorn told Boromir to follow them and guard them.<ref name=\"Breaking\" /> Boromir did as he was asked. When he found the Hobbits they were surrounded by dozens of Orcs. Boromir slew many of them and the rest fled. He began to lead the Hobbits back to the campsite, but they were attacked again by at least 100 Orcs. Boromir sounded the Great Horn and fought valiantly to prevent the Orcs from seizing Merry and Pippin. He was pierced arrow after arrow, but he refused to die so easily. Many arrows were shot before he fell at last, and the Hobbits were taken prisoner.<ref name=\"Departure\">{{TT|Departure}}</ref>\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - The Death of Boromir.jpg|thumb|left|''The Death of Boromir'' by Peter Xavier Price]]\nBoromir was still alive when Aragorn found him. At least twenty Orcs lay slain around him. Boromir still held his sword, though the blade had been broken off at the hilt, and the Great Horn had been cloven in two. Before he died, Boromir told Aragorn that he had tried to take the Ring from Frodo. He asked Aragorn to forgive him, that he had fallen to the lure of the Ring, but Aragorn assured him that he was forgiven and that he had redeemed himself before he died. Then Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas laid Boromir's body in one of the boats. His shattered horn and sword they laid across his lap and the weapons of his enemies were laid at his feet. Aragorn and Legolas sang the [[Song of Boromir]] while they set his funeral boat adrift on the Anduin. The river then carried Boromir's body over the [[Rauros|Rauros-falls]].<ref name=\"Departure\" />\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - The funeral-boat of Boromir.jpg|thumb|''The funeral-boat of Boromir'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nThree nights later, Faramir was sitting by the banks of the Anduin in Osgiliath when he saw or envisioned a boat float past him on the river. Faramir had heard the Great Horn sounding in the distance when Boromir was in need, and now he saw his brother's body laid out in the boat, but the Great Horn was missing. The two halves of the horn were later washed ashore and they were returned to Denethor. It was said that the boat bearing Boromir's body was borne down the Anduin and out into the Sea.<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n*''See also: [[Boromir (Lord of Ladros)#Etymology|Boromir (Lord of Ladros): Etymology]] and [[Borlach#Other versions of the legendarium|Borlach: Other versions of the legendarium]]''\n\n{{Pronounce|Boromir.mp3|Ardamir}} \nBoromir was named after [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, fifth paragraph</ref>\n\n''Boromir'' is mentioned to be one of the few [[Gondor Sindarin|Gondorian names]] of mixed forms.<ref>{{App|Men}}, footnote</ref> It has been suggested that the name ''Boromir'' consists of [[Sindarin]] ''boro(n)'' (\"steadfast\") and [[Quenya]] ''[[míre]]'' (\"jewel\").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 224</ref>\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | PRI | | | | | | STE | | |PRI=''[[Princes of Dol Amroth|Princes of<br/>Dol Amroth]]''|STE=''[[Ruling Steward|Ruling Stewards<br/>of Gondor]]''}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | | | |:| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | ADR | | | | | | ECT | | |ADR=[[Adrahil]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2917|n}} - {{TA|3010|n}}''</small>|ECT=[[Ecthelion II]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2886|n}} - {{TA|2984|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | IVR | | IMR | | FIN |y| DEN | | |IVR=[[Ivriniel]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2947|n}}''</small>|IMR=[[Imrahil]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2955|n}} - {{FoA|34}}''</small>|FIN=[[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2950|n}} - {{TA|2988|n}}''</small>|DEN=[[Denethor|Denethor II]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2930|n}} - {{TA|3019|n}}''†</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | BOR | | FAR |y| EOW |BOR='''BOROMIR'''<br/><small>''{{TA|2978|n}} - {{TA|3019|n}}''†</small>|FAR=[[Faramir]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2983|n}} - {{FoA|82}}''</small>|EOW=[[Éowyn]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2995|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | ELB | | |ELB=[[Elboron]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[File:Jean Fouquet-Mort de Roland.jpg|thumb|Roland is found by his brother Baudoin next to his olifant, during the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Roncevaux|Battle of Roncevaux]].]]\nMany similarities have been suggested between [[wikipedia:Roland|Roland]], the paladin of Charlemagne, and Boromir: both bore a white horn, were military leaders who defended their lord's realm, shared the flaw of pride and both died tragically away from home in the wilderness while defending their companions against an overwhelming enemy force and blew their horn before their death.<ref>[[Gerard Seaman]], \"Old French Literature\", published in ''[[J.R.R.

But such is Faramir. Less reckless and eager than [[Boromir]], but not less resolute.|[[Beregond]] in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"[[Minas Tirith]]\"}}\n'''Faramir''' was the last [[Ruling Steward|Ruling]] [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] and the first [[Prince of Ithilien]]. \n\nThe second of [[Denethor]]'s two sons, Faramir was briefly the [[Ruling Steward]] after his father's death. Upon the arrival of the true king, King [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]], he laid down his office, but Elessar renewed the hereditary appointment of Steward as the advisor to the King. Faramir was also appointed Prince of Ithilien.<ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 207</ref>\n\n==History==\nFaramir was born in {{TA|2983}}, five years after [[Boromir]]. Faramir was five when his mother [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]] died. When that happened, Boromir and Faramir formed a great bond with each other. \n[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Brothers study.jpg|left|thumb|''Brothers study'' by Catherine Chmiel]]\nHe grew to become a brave warrior admired by his soldiers, although unlike his brother, he did not care much for battle and arms and needless danger. He gained from the wisdom of [[Gandalf]] who visited [[Minas Tirith]], and loved lore and music; his gentle nature (and love of Gandalf) displeased his father. Although Denethor grew cold and grim and favoured Boromir over him, there was no rivalry between the brothers; Boromir was always his helper and protector.<ref name=\"stew\">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n\nTwice Faramir had a [[Seek for the Sword that was broken|prophetic dream]] and didn't speak about it, until he saw it again with his brother. [[20 June|The following day]] saw [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath]] which started the [[War of the Ring]]. The two brothers commanded the defences of [[Osgiliath]]. They protected the last bridge across the [[Anduin]] until it was destroyed. Only the two brothers and two others survived by swimming.<ref name=\"council\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nSeeking clues for the dream, Boromir set out for [[Rivendell]].<ref name=\"council\" /> Faramir never heard from his brother again, until the [[Great Horn]] was heard in Minas Tirith, and a few days later he saw Boromir dead in a funeral boat, prepared by [[Fellowship of the Ring|his companions]], floating the Anduin.<ref name=\"appB\">{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nOn [[1 March]], his father sent him for an errand to Ithilien where Faramir went to command the [[Rangers of Ithilien]].<ref name=\"appB\" />\n===In Ithilien===\n[[File:John Howe - Faramir 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Faramir'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nFaramir acted as a ranger harassing [[Haradrim]] and keeping evil things from entering Ithilien from [[Minas Morgul]]. During one such raid he found [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Gollum]] observing an attack by his rangers on a column of [[Haradrim]]. The former two were captured as spies by the rangers though Gollum eluded them. Frodo was questioned by Faramir concerning their errand. Frodo recounted the journeys of the Fellowship and its members but referred to the [[Quest of the Ring|purpose]] of the travels only cryptically. During the questioning he denied knowledge of Gollum but revealed that he travelled with both Aragorn, the [[Heir of Isildur]], and Boromir.<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref>\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Window on the West.jpg|thumb|''The Window on the West'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nFaramir informed Frodo of Boromir's death, implying Frodo's involvement in it, though Frodo had not known of Boromir's death until that very moment. Unsure of how to deal with his captives, Faramir led Frodo and Sam, blindfolded, to [[Henneth Annûn]]. There he questioned them further in private, learning that the hobbits' errand was linked to the 'Isildur's bane' that had sent Boromir to Rivendell in the first place. Eager to earn their trust Faramir delivered his famous oath, saying that he \"...would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs\". In a slip up however Samwise revealed the nature of 'Isildur's bane' and so Faramir was tested, just as Boromir had been, by the lure of [[The One Ring|The Ring]]. Where Boromir failed Faramir succeeded, leading Samwise to remark that Faramir had \"shown [his] quality\".<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref>\n\nDuring the night, Faramir's watch spotted Gollum fishing in the Forbidden Pool. Faramir called Frodo to him who confessed to the part of Gollum in their errand, begging Faramir not to slay him. Gollum was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Frodo. [[8 March|The following morning]]<ref name=\"appB\" /> Faramir released Frodo and Sam (with Gollum), but warned them strongly against taking the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]].<ref>{{TT|IV6}}</ref> Faramir with his men also left the refuge [[9 March|the next day]].<ref name=\"appB\" />\n\n===In Pelennor/Minas Tirith===\nFaramir returned to Osgiliath, supervising the defence there. However he retreated over the [[Pelennor Fields]] to report to Denethor on [[10 March]]<ref name=\"appB\" /> and was almost caught by the [[Nazgûl]] on their [[Fell beasts]], but was saved by Gandalf. Faramir reached Minas Tirith, telling Denethor and Gandalf of what befell in Ithilien, but [[11 March|the next day]] he departed to Osgiliath<ref name=\"appB\" /> to supervise the defences at his father's bidding. In this venture the host of the [[Witch-king]] came upon Osgiliath and on [[12 March]] Faramir retreated to the [[Causeway Forts]].<ref name=\"appB\" /> He was struck down by the [[Black Breath]] and only a sortie by [[Imrahil]] and his knights saved the wounded (including Faramir) from that onset and on [[13 March]] they were brought to Minas Tirith.<ref name=\"appB\" /><ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Sun Unveiled.jpg|thumb|''The Sun Unveiled'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nFaramir remained out of action for the rest of the War of the Ring. During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] Denethor planned to burn his stricken son alongside him and Faramir was once again saved by Gandalf, though Denethor completed his suicide.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref> After this he was taken to the [[Houses of Healing]] and healed by Aragorn after the battle.<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref> Faramir spent the rest of the war recovering in the Houses of Healing where he met [[Éowyn]], also grievously wounded.<ref name=\"RK|VI5\">{{RK|VI5}}</ref> The two fell in love and were married after the war.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>\n\n===After the War of the Ring===\nAfter the destruction of the One Ring and the [[Battle of the Morannon]], Faramir, as Steward, led the ceremony in the crowning of Aragorn as King of Gondor and Arnor.<ref name=\"RK|VI5\"/> Aragorn reinstated the original role of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] before the failing of the [[Kings of Gondor]] and made Faramir the Prince of Ithilien. As Prince of Ithilien, Faramir was one of the two Chief Commanders of King Elessar and his duty was to guard and maintain the eastern borders of Gondor. He also defeated the remaining enemies and cleansed the [[Morgul Vale]].\n\nFaramir and Éowyn settled down in [[Emyn Arnen]], a range of hills in Ithilien in sight of Minas Tirith, and Faramir became the [[Lord of Emyn Arnen]]. He and Éowyn had at least one son named [[Elboron]],<ref name=\"Elboron\" /> who followed his father as Steward and Prince of Ithilien when Faramir died in the year {{FoA|82}}. Faramir lived to be 120 years old, due to the large percentage of pure [[Dúnedain]] ancestry he possessed as a member of the Gondorian nobility.<ref>{{App|South}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Faramir'' is never glossed, and neither is indicated if it is [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]].\n\nAs all the Kings of Gondor and their heirs had names in Quenya,<ref>{{App|F1ii}}</ref> and the name is also attested as a name of the royal family (in the case of [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]] son of [[Ondoher]]) the name apparently is Quenya.\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | PRI | | | | | | STE | | | | | | | | |PRI=[[Princes of Dol Amroth|''Princes of<br/>Dol Amroth'']]|STE=[[Ruling Steward|''Ruling Stewards<br/>of Gondor'']]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | ADR | | | | | | ECT | | | | | | ROH |ADR=[[Adrahil]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2917|n}} - {{TA|3010|n}}''</small>|ECT=[[Ecthelion II]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2886|n}} - {{TA|2984|n}}''</small>|ROH=[[Kings of Rohan|''Kings of<br/>Rohan'']]}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |!| | | | | | | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | IVR | | IMR | | FIN |y| DEN | | EOM |y| THE |IVR=[[Ivriniel]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2947|n}}''</small>|IMR=[[Imrahil]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2955|n}} - {{FoA|34}}''</small>|FIN=[[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2950|n}} - {{TA|2988|n}}''</small>|DEN=[[Denethor|Denethor II]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2930|n}} - {{TA|3019|n}}''†</small>|EOM=[[Éomund]]<br/><small>''d. {{TA|3002|n}}''†</small>|THE=[[Théodwyn]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2963|n}} - {{TA|3002|n}}''†</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | |)|-|-|-|.| | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | BOR | | FAR |y| EOW | | |BOR=[[Boromir]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2978|n}} - {{TA|3019|n}}''†</small>|FAR='''FARAMIR'''<br/><small>''{{TA|2983|n}} - {{FoA|82}}''</small>|EOW=[[Éowyn]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2995|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ELB | | | | |ELB=[[Elboron]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ELB | | | | |ELB=[[Barahir (grandson of Faramir)|Barahir]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small><br/><ref group=\"note\">It is not certain that Barahir was the son of Elboron.</ref>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Inspiration==\nFaramir was, in the words of Tolkien, \"modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful\".<ref>{{L|244}}</ref> His appearance toward the end of ''[[The Two Towers]]'' apparently was as much of a surprise to Tolkien as it is to his readers. \"I am sure I did not invent him,\" he wrote. \"I did not even want him, though I like him\".<ref>{{L|66}}</ref> \n\nFaramir in many ways speaks for Tolkien, who was an officer in the British Army during [[World War I]], when he says, for example, \"I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness...

However, a young black-haired man is shown at Aragorn's coronation, sitting on a horse beside Éowyn. It can be guessed that this is a cameo of Faramir. Whether he had at any time a larger part, that was cut for time restraints, is unknown.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Faramir is voiced by [[Andrew Seear]]. Because Boromir already named him during the Council of Elrond - in the book, he is simply called \"my brother\" - much of the mystery surrounding Faramir's first appearance is lost to the attentive listener. His flight from the Nazgûl across the Pelennor is also omitted. However, unlike some adaptations Faramir's recovery in the Houses of Healing and his budding romance with Éowyn are included, as is his role at Aragorn's coronation.\n\n'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''\n:Faramir is portrayed as a blond, bearded man. He can be controlled by the player.\n\n'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''\n:Faramir is played by Friedhelm Ptok.\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:[[David Wenham]] plays Faramir in this adaptation. He does not at first let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them west to Osgiliath, crossing the river Anduin, and not until the Ringwraiths attack the city does he release them. Many fans of the book criticise this change, saying that it seriously damages the character, who is meant to emulate the medieval chivalric code and contrast with Boromir. [[Peter Jackson]]'s explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third movie, and so a new climax was needed. Another explanation often cited is that it was felt that for dramatic reasons it was necessary to show character ''development'', which meant that Faramir had to go through some kind of struggle or difficult decision. Jackson also argued that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent, at least in the eyes of a film audience, and would weaken the films' portrayal of the Ring. However, despite these comments, Aragorn still resists the Ring easily at the end of the first movie, which acts as a contradiction to Jackson's claim.\n\n:In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], Jackson has included a flashback scene showing that Denethor has been neglecting him and favouring Boromir, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. The relationship is similarly strained in the books, but there his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Ithilien. On the whole, however, new Extended Edition scenes with Faramir brought the character closer to the sympathetic treatment of the books.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:Faramir's role in this film is largely faithful to that in the book.\n\n'''2002-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Faramir is provided by Jozef Vajda. The same actor also portrayed Faramir's brother Boromir earlier in the radio series.\n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Faramir's role in the War of the Ring is relatively minor in the game, as by the time the player reaches Minas Tirith Faramir has already been wounded and lies in a fever. His first prominent appearance is not until King Elessar's coronation. Afterwards, Aragorn charges the Steward and the Rangers of Ithilien with cleansing the evil of Minas Morgul and the Morgul Vale. Faramir leads the Rangers to establish several camps outside the dead city. Eventually he joins [[Damrod]]'s team inside the walls Minas Morgul itself, working to combat the evil on the upper levels of the city.\n\n{{notes}}\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race= gondorian\n| house= [[House of Húrin]]\n| born={{TA|2983}}\n| died={{FoA|82}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Denethor|Denethor II]]\n| list=27th [[Ruling Steward|Ruling Steward of Gondor]] (''de jure'')\n| dates=[[15 March]] - [[1 May]], {{TA|3019}}\n| next=Position abolished\n| nvac=None\n}}\n{{seq\n| pvac=Vacant\n| prev=[[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]], 969 years earlier\n| list=[[Steward of Gondor|Steward to the King of Gondor]]\n| dates=[[1 May]], {{TA|3019}} - {{FoA|82}}\n| next=[[Elboron]]\n| nrow=2\n}}\n{{seq\n| pvac=None\n| prev=New title\n| list=[[Prince of Ithilien]]\n| dates=[[1 May]], {{TA|3019}} - {{FoA|82}}\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{rulingstewards}}\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Fourth Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:House of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Rangers]]\n[[Category:Ruling stewards]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Stewards]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Faramir (Sohn von Denethor II.)]]\n[[fi:Faramir]]",

She was the daughter of [[Finarfin]] and [[Eärwen]] as well as younger sister to [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] (later [[King of Nargothrond]]), [[Angrod]], and [[Aegnor]]. She took part in the [[Exile of the Noldor]], following [[Fëanor]] in his rebellion. However, she opposed the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and crossed the [[Helcaraxë]] with the rest of [[Fingolfin]]'s followers. After arriving in [[Beleriand]], she lived mainly in [[Doriath]], where she befriended [[Melian]]. Later, with her husband [[Celeborn]], she ruled over the [[Silvan Elves|woodland Elves]] of [[Lothlórien]], and together they had a daughter, [[Celebrían]], who married [[Elrond]]. \n\nShe is described as \"the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in [[Middle-earth]]\",<ref name=\"Rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref> and the \"greatest of Elven women\".<ref>{{App|B1}}, p. 1082</ref> Throughout the Third Age it was unknown who wielded the [[Three Rings]],<ref name=\"Third\">{{App|TA}}, pp. 1085-8</ref> but during the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel revealed to [[Frodo Baggins]] that she was the bearer of [[Nenya]].<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref>{{rp|365}} After the War, she returned to the [[Uttermost West]].\n\n==History==\n===Elder Days===\n====Life in Aman====\n{{Seealso|#Other versions of the legendarium|l1=Other versions of the legendarium}}\nGaladriel was born in [[Eldamar]] in the [[Year of the Trees 1362]].<ref>{{MR|P2l}}, p. 106</ref> She was the fourth child of [[Finarfin]], prince of the [[Noldor]], who named her '''''Artanis'''''.<ref name=\"Finwe\">{{PM|Finwe}}, pp. 346-7</ref> Her mother was [[Eärwen]], princess of the [[Falathrim|Teleri]], who named her '''''Nerwen''''' (\"Man-maiden\"). Galadriel grew beautiful and tall, even for the women of the Noldor, being strong of body, will, and mind, \"a match for both the [[loremasters]] and the athletes of the [[Eldar]] in the days of their youth.\"<ref name=\"Case\">{{PM|Case}}, pp. 337-8</ref> \n[[File:Marya Filatova - Galadriel.jpg|left|thumb|''Galadriel'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]\nIndeed, \"she was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats\". This custom was the origin of her [[Sindarin]] [[Epessë|name]] '''''Galadriel''''' (\"Maiden crowned with gleaming hair\"),<ref name=\"Amazon\">{{L|348}}, p. 428</ref> which was given to (and accepted by) her much later, in [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{NM|P3xvi}}, p. 352, note 8</ref> The gleaming of her hair was not a mere poetic reference: [[Hair of Galadriel|her hair]] was held a marvel unmatched. It mingled and surpassed the gold hair of her father and the starlike silver of her mother, so the Eldar said that both [[light]]s of the [[Two Trees]] were captured in her tresses. It was also said that this first gave the idea to her uncle [[Fëanor]] of capturing the merged light of the Trees, which would result in the making of the [[Silmarils]]. He asked her three times for one of her tresses, but she always refused. Fëanor and Galadriel were always unfriends, both being the greatest Eldar in Valinor; and if Fëanor was greater than she, she was wiser, and her wisdom grew with the long years. For she also had an outstanding gift to see into the minds of others, and, though she judged most with kindness, she hated and feared the darkness in Fëanor, not perceiving that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the Noldor, including her own.<ref name=\"Case\" />\n\nThere was still bliss in Valinor when she was born, but soon she was influenced by the [[Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor|unrest of the Noldor]] and lost her inner peace ever after. She was proud, like most of the [[House of Finwë]], and like her closest brother [[Finrod]], \"she had dreams of far lands and dominions that might be her own to order as she would without tutelage\". But deep in herself, she had the noble spirit of the [[Vanyar]], which did not allow her to forget the reverence for the [[Valar]].<ref name=\"Case\" />\n\nDuring the [[Darkening of Valinor]] and the rebellion of Fëanor, Galadriel was the only woman of the Noldor who stood among the rising princes. She swore no [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]], but the [[Speech of Fëanor|words of Fëanor]] concerning [[Middle-earth]] kindled a desire in her heart, as she was eager to see those wide unguarded lands and rule a realm of her own.<ref name=\"Flight\">{{S|Flight}}</ref> Like the rest of the [[House of Finarfin]], she was also supportive of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]] by the desire to aid their [[Sindar]]in relatives in Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Case\" /> \n\nEven though she was one of the leaders in this revolt,<ref name=\"RGEO\">{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 60</ref> during the troubles that followed she fought fiercely against Fëanor by defending her mother's kin during the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and the rape of the ships. Afterwards, she even desired to follow Fëanor to disturb him in all the ways that she could, but nothing could have moved her to return since she had begun her way to exile, as her pride was strong then as it was thereafter.<ref name=\"Case\" /> She kept moving forward even under the [[Doom of Mandos]], when her father Finarfin abandoned the march and returned to Valinor, and even when Fëanor left behind the hosts of Fingolfin and the children of Finarfin. Then she, along with Finrod and [[Fingolfin]] and his sons, led her people into the bitter North and crossed the terrors of [[Helcaraxë]]. After many losses, they arrived on the northern shores of the [[Outer Lands]].<ref name=\"Flight\" /><ref group=\"note\">The nature of Galadriel's exile (if she was innocent or guilty of pride) and the subsequent idea of a ban upon her return were not defined in Tolkien's first conceptions of Galadriel, so she being a rebel exile was a later reinterpretation. He would also change his mind about it, but for this article we chose this version for having the most complete narratives. For a more complete account of this matter, see the entire ''[[#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.</ref>\n\n====Arrival to Middle-earth====\n[[File:Līga Kļaviņa - Love at First Sight.jpg|thumb|''Love at First Sight'' by [[:Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa]]]]\nOnce in [[Beleriand]], those of the House of Finarfin were eager to enter [[Doriath]], but King [[Elu Thingol]] received the Noldor coldly, and only allowed entrance to those invited by him after some inquiries.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|13}}</ref> Finally in {{FA|52}},<ref>{{GA|74}}</ref> Finrod and Galadriel became long guests in Doriath, but her brother eventually departed to the [[Caverns of Narog]] to establish the stronghold of [[Nargothrond]]. Galadriel did not go with him, and remained in Doriath with [[Celeborn]], a kinsman of Thingol, as there was great love between them.<ref name=\"Noldor\">{{S|15}}</ref> Despite their love, they did not marry each other, following the [[Elven life cycle|custom among the Eldar]] of avoiding marriage and child-bearing during the war,<ref name=\"Scales\">{{NM|P1ix}}, pp. 65-6</ref> but they were eventually betrothed till the war ended.<ref name=\"Ages\">{{NM|P1xviii}}, p. 149</ref> Meanwhile, she dwelt with Queen [[Melian]], from whom she learned much of the wisdom of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Return\" />\n\nThe Western Corn necessary to make [[lembas]] had been lost in Beleriand until the Noldor brought new grain back, and it flourished by the grace of the Valar. Galadriel was one of the main inheritors of it and of the art of the making of lembas.<ref>{{NM|P3iv}}, p. 296</ref> It is safe to assume Melian benefited from this.\n\nYears passed in Doriath, and Galadriel became dear to Melian, and they spoke often to one another about Valinor. Melian was eager to learn the causes of the [[Exile of the Noldor]], but Galadriel would tell her nothing of what occurred after the death of the Trees. In the year {{FA|66|n}},<ref>{{GA|91}}</ref> Melian asked her directly about this, and Galadriel revealed the story of the [[Silmarils]] and how the Noldor fled from Aman against the will of the Valar, though she still left out the Oath of Fëanor, the Kinslaying, and the burning of the Ships at [[Losgar]]. Melian was able to discern a darkness that was left unsaid, but Galadriel refused to tell her more. Thus, Thingol became concerned regarding the Noldor, and he was informed soon afterwards of the Noldor's dark deeds in Aman, and it chanced that the children of Finarfin were visiting Galadriel in Doriath. Egged on by his accusing words, [[Angrod]] told everything, and Galadriel's brothers departed heavy-hearted.<ref name=\"Noldor\" />\n[[File:Ten Thousand Leaves - Galadriel and Melian.jpeg|thumb|left|''Galadriel and Melian'' by [[:Category:Images by Ten Thousand Leaves|Ten Thousand Leaves]]]]\nDespite all this, Galadriel stayed in Doriath until {{FA|102|n}},<ref name=\"Nargothrond\">{{GA|108}}</ref> when the kingdom of [[Nargothrond]] was finished and a feast was held for all the children of Finarfin. She dwelt for a while in Nargothrond, and in this time she asked Finrod why he remained unmarried. Her brother answered with dark [[foresight]]s about his kingdom.<ref name=\"Noldor\" /> Back in Doriath, in {{FA|420|n}},<ref>{{GA|129}}</ref> Galadriel heard another foretelling, as Melian told her about [[Beren|a Man]] who shall cross into Doriath moved by a doom greater than the [[Girdle of Melian]].<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>\n\nGaladriel did not have any significant role in the general course of events in the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]], but she might have been well informed of the deaths of her brothers [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] during the [[Dagor Bragollach]]; and of Finrod's, while he was held in captivity by [[Sauron]] in the year {{FA|465|n}}.<ref>{{GA|§198-199}}</ref> At some point before the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] in {{FA|495|n}},<ref>{{GA|275}}</ref> she and Celeborn passed over [[Blue Mountains|the mountains]]<ref name=\"Mirror\" />{{rp|357}} to [[Eriador]], far from the turmoil of the last years of the [[First Age]].\n\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the [[First Age]], [[Eönwë]], herald of [[Manwë]], summoned the [[Elves of Beleriand]] to the West, so they were received in [[Tol Eressëa]] and under the pardon of the Valar. However, some did not wish to leave Middle-earth, such as Celeborn.<ref name=\"Earendil\">{{S|24}}</ref> Being one of the chief leaders of the Noldorin rebellion, Galadriel was not allowed to return<ref name=\"L|297\">{{L|297}}, p. 386</ref> and a ban was set upon her, to which she replied that she had no wish to do so.<ref name=\"RGEO\" /> The same pride that led her out of Aman still moved her, and she rejected the pardon of the Valar,<ref name=\"Case\" /> for as she had once lived in Aman itself, Eressëa seemed only a \"second best\". She was also moved by love for Celeborn, to whom she probably married around this time.<ref name=\"Scales\" /><ref group=\"note\">The marriage of Galadriel and Celeborn, as well as when they crossed over the mountains, was not well defined by Tolkien.

He was, however, perceived by Galadriel, who noticed there was a controlling evil, and that it was spreading above the world, coming from the East beyond the [[Misty Mountains]]. She also thought this 'residue of evil' could only be fought with an alliance of all its enemies. Therefore, she and Celeborn moved eastwards and got established in the realm of [[Eregion]] near [[Khazad-dûm]].<ref group=\"note\">In the source used here, Galadriel and Celeborn are described as the first founders of Eregion, but later sources mention Celebrimbor as founder and lord of Eregion before their coming. See ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref> Celeborn was not fond of [[Dwarves]], but she saw the importance of getting close to them, for she saw military interests even with them. Also, she was a Noldo, and therefore close to them in mind and in the passion for crafts; and in Valinor she had learned from [[Yavanna]] and [[Aulë]], the creator of the Dwarves himself.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|235}} \n\nSome Noldor were also interested in establishing a realm near Khazad-dûm because they knew [[mithril]] had been discovered there. Therefore, many Elven-smiths came to Eregion and created good relations with the Dwarves. [[Celebrimbor]], a descendant of [[Fëanor]] (and therefore a distant cousin of Galadriel), was the greatest of the craft-men and the Lord of Eregion.<ref name=\"Second\" /> He was its main builder and in {{SA|750|n}} [[Ost-in-Edhil]], the main city of the realm, was begun. The power of Galadriel and Celeborn also grew: thanks to the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, they had contact with the [[Nandor]]in realm of [[Lórinand]], on the other side of the Misty Mountains. Thanks to Galadriel's influence upon Lórinand, Sauron's machinations there were fruitless.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|236}} She also got in contact with [[Númenor]], having a meeting with King [[Aldarion]] when he came to [[Tharbad]] around {{SA|883|n}}-884.<ref>{{UT|4}}, ''The further course of the narrative'', pp. 205-6</ref>\n[[File:Alan Lee - Galadriel in Moria.jpg|thumb|''Galadriel in Moria'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nAbout the year {{SA|1200|n}}, Sauron came in disguise to Eriador, but he was only welcomed in Eregion by Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths, who were interested in his advice on craftsmanship.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|236}} Galadriel was not deceived, and rejected him, saying that he was not in the training of Aulë as he claimed.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, \"Notes\", p. 254, note 7</ref> \"''He perceived at once that Galadriel would be his chief adversary and obstacle, and he endeavoured therefore to placate her, bearing her scorn with outward patience and courtesy''\". At the same time, without her knowledge, Sauron influenced Celebrimbor and his [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] against Galadriel and Celeborn. Finally, he moved them to expell Galadriel from Eregion at some time between {{SA|1350|n}} and 1400.<ref group=\"note\">As in the previous note, the source used here presents Celebrimbor as a subordinate of Galadriel and Celeborn, so in this episode he leads a coup against them.</ref> Thus, Galadriel and Celebrían left through Khazad-dûm to Lórinand, although Celeborn would not enter the Dwarvish realm and remained in Eregion.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|237}}\n\nWhen Sauron made [[the One Ring]] in {{SA|1600}}, his treachery was discovered by Celebrimbor.<ref name=\"Second\" /> The elven-smith came to Lórinand, seeking counsel from Galadriel. They did not find the strength to destroy the [[Rings of Power]], but she advised him to hide the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves where Sauron could not find them. Therefore he gave her [[Nenya]], the White Ring, and the other Rings were given to other Elven lords.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|237}} This was done in {{SA|1693|n}}, the same year Sauron began [[War of the Elves and Sauron|the war against the Elves]].<ref name=\"Second\" />\n\nWith the invasion of Eriador, [[Sack of Eregion|Eregion was destroyed]] and Celebrimbor killed. Despite using torture, Sauron could not learn from him where the Elven Rings were, although he suspected they were kept by Galadriel and Gil-galad.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|238}} But thanks to the military intervention of [[Númenor]], Sauron was defeated in {{SA|1700|n}}.<ref name=\"Second\" /> Soon afterwards, Galadriel was affected by [[sea-longing]], and she decided to leave Lórinand and dwell beside the sea.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|240}} As one of the [[High-elves]], her yearning for the sea was unavoidable, and now she became burdened with the desire to cross to the Blessed Realm, but the ban upon her impeded it.<ref name=\"RGEO\" /> Thus she did not go to the sea yet, but crossed west of the mountains through Khazad-dûm with Celebrían. Seeking Celeborn, they travelled to [[Imladris]], a refuge created by [[Elrond]] during the war. Once there, a [[White Council|Council]] was held, in which it was decided that Imladris would be the Elvish stronghold in the East, rather than the desolate Eregion.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|239–40}}\n\nGaladriel, Celeborn and Celebrían dwelt a long time in Imladris, but at some point they left and moved near the sea, to [[Belfalas]], at the place later known as [[Dol Amroth]]. There were few inhabitants there, but they were visited by Nandorin parties.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|238}} Apparently, they returned to Lórien twice before the [[Last Alliance]] and the end of the Second Age,<ref name=\"Amroth\">{{UT|Amroth}}, pp. 243-5</ref> but of their whereabouts during the final millennia of that Age nothing else is known.\n\n===Third Age===\n====Rule in Lórien====\nIn early [[Third Age]], in the year {{TA|109|n}}, Galadriel and Celeborn's daughter [[Celebrían]] wedded [[Elrond]] the [[Half-elven]].<ref name=\"Third\" /> But they did not stay at first with her, for Galadriel was filled with [[Foresight|foreboding]], and was concerned about the growing shadow in [[Mirkwood]] and [[Dol Guldur]]. Therefore she and Celeborn made long journeys investigating [[Rhovanion]], going from [[Gondor]] and the borders of [[Mordor]] to [[Thranduil]] in the north. They also stayed a long time in Lórien with king [[Amroth]], for Galadriel saw with her wisdom that this prosperous realm could be a stronghold against the growing Shadow, if it had better rule.<ref name=\"Amroth\" /> At this point, the [[Istari]] arrived in Middle-earth, and only Galadriel, Elrond and [[Círdan]] knew [[Valinor|where]] they came from.<ref name=\"Rings\" /> Around the year {{TA|1100|n}}, the [[Wise]] (including Galadriel as one the chief Eldar) were well aware of the evil dwelling in Dol Guldur, but thought it was one of the [[Nazgûl]].<ref name=\"Third\" />\n\nAfter their enquiries, Galadriel and Celeborn passed over the mountains to Imladris, and there dwelt for many years with their kin.<ref name=\"Amroth\" />\n\nBetween the years {{TA|1980}}-{{TA|1981|n}}, [[Durin's Bane|a terror]] appeared in Khazad-dûm and the Dwarves abandoned the realm, while the many Silvan Elves from Lórien had to flee south.<ref name=\"Third\" /> To make things worse, Amroth was lost, leaving no heir, and the Elven realm was left without a ruler. Therefore Celeborn and Galadriel went there, welcomed by the people, and took up the rule jointly, but refused to take the [[King of Lórien|royal title]] and were called the [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim]]. Saving the realm from the perils of the moment, they dwelt and ruled permanently there.<ref name=\"Amroth\" />\n\nAs the shadow of Dol Guldur grew again, the [[White Council]] was formed in {{TA|2463|n}}.<ref name=\"Third\" /> It was summoned by Galadriel,<ref>{{FR|II7}}, p. 357</ref> who, being a good friend of [[Gandalf]], recommended that he be made head of the Council. But this distinction fell instead to [[Saruman]].<ref name=\"Rings\" /> \n\nIn {{TA|2510|n}}, her daughter Celebrían departed to the West after being wounded by Orcs.<ref name=\"Third\" /> The same year, she aided [[Eorl]] and his [[Rohirrim|riders]] in the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], creating a white mist that drove out the shadows from Dol Guldur.<ref>{{UT|8b}}, pp. 298-9</ref>\n\nThe White Council would not take action until Gandalf discovered that the shadow growing in Dol Guldur was [[Sauron]]. After deliberating, the Council joined forces and drove Sauron out of Dol Guldur in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref name=\"Third\" />\n\nSome years later, [[Aragorn]] entered Lothlórien after many travels, and was admitted by Galadriel. She bade him change his worn-out clothes and dressed him like a proper prince. At that time, Aragorn became betrothed to her granddaughter [[Arwen]].<ref>{{App|A1v}}, p. 1060</ref>\n\n====War of the Ring====\n[[File:Ralph Damiani - The Trial.png|thumb|right|''The Trial'' by [[:Category:Images by Ralph Damiani|Ralph Damiani]]]]\nGaladriel and Celeborn were well informed about the [[Company of the Ring]], its members and their mission, before its coming to Lothlórien, perhaps informed by messages from Rivendell.<ref>{{FR|II6}}, p. 350</ref> In the evening of [[17 January]] of {{TA|3019}}, the Company arrived at [[Caras Galadhon]].<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|B3}}, pp. 1092-4</ref> Coming to the [[talan]] of the Lady and Lord, each member was greeted by name by Celeborn. Noticing that Gandalf was missing, Galadriel asked where he was, for she wished to speak with him. Hearing that they had encountered [[Durin's Bane]] and that this was in fact a [[Balrog]] from ancient times, Celeborn criticized the passing of the Company through Moria. However, Galadriel was more sympathetic, especially towards [[Gimli]], who bowed to her in respect. Before inviting the members of the Company to rest and heal there, she looked deep into their eyes and they all felt their hearts exposed.<ref name=\"Mirror\" />{{rp|354–7}}\n\nA month later, in [[15 February]],<ref name=\"Great\" /> [[Frodo Baggins]] the [[Ringbearer|bearer of the One Ring]], was walking in the evening with [[Sam]] when they encountered Galadriel. She led them to an enclosed garden and showed them a silver basin. Filling it with water, a [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]] was formed, which allowed them to see things that were and that might come. Frodo saw the [[Eye of Sauron]], and she explained that she knew well Frodo's mind, for Sauron also tried to look into hers. She also [[Keepers of the Three Rings|kept]] a [[Ring of Power]], and showing him [[Nenya]], the Ring of Adamant, she explained that its power would disappear once Frodo destroyed the One, and Lórien would fade. Then Frodo offered the One Ring to her, and she laughed in response, saying: \"''I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer.''\" Then she began to ponder how powerful she would become with the Ring's power, and from Nenya came a great light that covered her overwhelming height. But the light faded and she laughed again, saying: \"''I pass the test. I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel''.\"<ref name=\"Mirror\" />{{rp|360–6}} Indeed, with this rejection of temptation and her long opposition against Sauron, the ban upon her return to Aman was finally lifted.<ref name=\"RGEO\" />\n\nThat night, the Lord and Lady summoned the Company and spoke of their departure, which was appointed for the following morning. The next day, she sent the Fellowship off on their Quest, furnished with [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]] for all the members, including [[lembas]] and [[Elven cloaks]]. Later, a farewell party was held, which the Lord and Lady attended in a [[Swan-ships|swan boat]]; from it, Galadriel sang a [[Galadriel's Song|song]] about [[Eldamar]]. After everyone ate and drank, she proceed to give [[Gifts of Galadriel|specific gifts]] to each member.<ref name=\"Farewell\">{{FR|II8}}, pp. 367-78</ref>\n\nAmong the gifts was the [[Elfstone]], which she gave to Aragorn from Arwen \"''as a token of hope''\".<ref name=\"Farewell\" /> The jewel was also in part a bridal gift and a token of the future wedding of Arwen and Aragorn, done following the [[Elven customs|Noldorin custom]] in which the bride's mother should give to the bridegroom a jewel (Arwen's mother Celebrían had departed long ago, so Galadriel did it in her place).<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}, p. 211</ref> Galadriel stated she was unsure as to what to give Gimli, and asked what he wanted. After complimenting her beauty, he requested a single strand of [[Hair of Galadriel|her hair]]. Instead, she rewarded him with three strands, which he promised to put into an imperishable crystal in memory of her.

Tolkien|Tolkien]] as \"maiden crowned with a garland of bright radiance\",<ref name=\"Finwe\" /> \"Maiden crowned with gleaming hair\",<ref name=\"Amazon\" /> \"glittering garland\",<ref>{{L|345}}, p. 423</ref> and \"maiden crowned with a radiant garland\".<ref name=\"SApp\">{{S|Appendix}}, ''kal-''</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 44-5</ref> ''Galadriel'' consists of ''[[galad]]'' (\"light, radiance\") + ''[[rî]]'' (\"crown\").<ref name=\"Finwe\" /> It was an [[epessë]] given to her in her youth because, while doing exercise, she usually bound up her long golden hair as a crown.<ref name=\"Amazon\">{{L|348}}, p. 428</ref>\n\nTolkien notes that the element ''galad'' had no relation to Sindarin ''[[galadh]]'' or [[Silvan]] ''galað'' (\"tree\").<ref name=\"SApp\" /><ref>{{MR|P3I5}}, p. 182 (commentary to §42)</ref> Due to this coincidence the name ''Galadriel'' was occasionally rendered as '''''Galadhriel''''', as Tolkien explains:\n{{blockquote|When Celeborn and Galadriel became the rulers of the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Galadhrim]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, the name of Galadriel became associated with trees, an association that was aided by the name of her husband, which also appeared to contain a tree-word; so that outside [[Lórien]] among those whose memories of the ancient days and Galadriel's history had grown dim her name was often altered to 'Galadhriel', though never in Lórien itself.<ref>{{UT|6e}}, p. 267</ref>}}\n\n==Other names==\nAt the time of her birth, [[Finarfin]] named his only daughter '''''Artanis'''''. Her [[father-name]] meant \"Noble Woman\" in [[Quenya]], from ''[[arta]]'' + ''[[nís]]''.<ref name=\"Finwe\" />\n\nDue to Artanis's height and her great strength of body and will, Eärwen chose the [[Quenya]] name '''''Nerwen''''', meaning \"man-maiden\".<ref name=\"Case\" />\n\n'''''Alatáriel''''' was the [[Telerin]] name given to Galadriel by [[Celeborn]], meaning \"Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland\", which referred to her hair.<ref name=\"Finwe\" /> The Quenya form of this name was '''''Altáriel''''', although the proper form would have been '''''Ñaltariel'''''. Its [[Sindarin]] cognate '''''Galadriel''''' was chosen by her to be her Sindarin name, because it was the most beautiful of her names and had been given to her as an [[epessë]] by her lover, Teleporno of the Teleri, whom she wedded later in Beleriand.<ref name=\"Finwe\" /><ref group=\"note\">''Teleporno'' was the Teleri-styled named for Lord Celeborn: \"It is only of course in the late version that Celeborn appears with a High-elven, rather than Sindarin, name: ''Teleporno''\", {{UT|6e}}, p. 266</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| MIR |y|~|~|~|~|~|~| FIN |y| IND | | | | | | | | OLW | | |MIR=[[Míriel]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1170}}''</small>|FIN=[[Finwë]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1495}}''</small>|IND=[[Indis]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|OLW=[[Olwë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| | | FEA | | FDS | | FNG | | IRM | | FRF |y| EAW | | SON |FEA=[[Fëanor]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1169}} - {{YT|1497|n}}''</small>|FDS=[[Findis]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FNG=[[Fingolfin]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1190}} - {{FA|456}}''</small>|IRM=[[Írimë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FRF=[[Finarfin]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1230}}''</small>|EAW=[[Eärwen]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|SON=''unknown sons''}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|.| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | FRD | | ANG |y| ELD | | AEG | | GAL |y| CEL |FRD=[[Finrod]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1300}} - {{FA|465}}''</small>|ANG=[[Angrod]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|455}}''</small>|AEG=[[Aegnor]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|455}}''</small>|GAL='''GALADRIEL'''<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1362}}''</small>|ELD=[[Eldalótë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|CEL=[[Celeborn]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | ORO | | | | | | ELR |y| CLB | | |ORO=[[Orodreth]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|495}}''</small>|CLB=[[Celebrían]]<br /><small>''b. {{SA|300}}''</small>|ELR=[[Elrond]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|532}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | FIL | | GIL | | ELL | | ELO | | ARW |GIL=[[Gil-galad]]<br /><small>''d. {{SA|3441}}''</small>|FIL=[[Finduilas]]<sup>[[Finduilas#Notes|NB]]</sup><br /><small>''{{FA|272}} - {{FA|495|n}}''</small>|ELL=[[Elladan]]<br /><small>''b. {{TA|130}}''</small>|ELO=[[Elrohir]]<br /><small>''b. {{TA|130}}''</small>|ARW=[[Arwen]]<br /><small>''{{TA|241}} - {{FoA|121}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[File:Alan Lee - Galadriel.jpg|thumb|''Galadriel sketch'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\n{{quote|There is no part of the history of Middle-earth more full of problems than the story of Galadriel and Celeborn...|[[Christopher Tolkien]] in \"[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]\"}}\n\n===The History of ''The Lord of the Rings''===\nThe first appearance of the character of Galadriel in the [[legendarium]] was during the composition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The first reference [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] ever made to her was in some notes for the \"[[Lothlórien (chapter)|Lothlórien]]\" chapter, which mentioned that a \"Lord of Galadrim and a Lady\" went to the White Council. The following phrases are a stub of them receiving the Company of the Ring, both clad in white and with white hair. In other isolated notes about this chapter, Tolkien wondered \"if Galadriel is alone and is wife of Elrond.\"<ref>{{TI|XII}}, pp. 233, 236</ref>\n\nThe first mention of \"Keleborn and Galadriel\" by name was in the narrative of the [[The Mirror of Galadriel|following chapter]], although Tolkien considered other Elvish names before writing ''Galadriel'' in ink.<ref name=\"Galadriel\">{{TI|XIII}}</ref>{{rp|261}} There Galadriel describes Keleborn and herself as \"''wise beyond the measure of the Elves of Middle-earth''\", and says that they \"''have dwelt there since the Mountains were reared and the Sun was young''\", from which [[Christopher Tolkien]] deduced they were both conceived as [[exiled Noldor]].<ref name=\"Galadriel\" />{{rp|263}} After the episode with the Company, both names are changed, so she became ''Galadrien'' (\"tree-lady\") in the next pages.<ref name=\"Galadriel\" />{{rp|249}} Other notable details that were altered later include the white colour of her hair,<ref name=\"Galadriel\" />{{rp|256}} that she was the keeper of the [[Ring of Earth]],<ref name=\"Galadriel\" />{{rp|252}} and that after the departure of the Company, Frodo was supposed to never see Galadriel ever again.<ref>{{TI|XIVviii}}, p. 286</ref>\n\nIn a list of matters \"to be explained before the end\", Tolkien wondered about what happened with Galadriel after the War of the Ring:\n\n{{blockquote|They learn [...] that Nazgûl razed Lórien and Keleborn fled with a remnant to [[Mirkwood]]. Galadriel was lost or was hidden. Or shall Lórien be left slowly to fade? Yes. Galadriel parts with Keleborn who elects to stay in the world and [?woods]. She is seen by Frodo in old age, when he and Sam see Galadriel and Bilbo...<ref>{{TI|XXVI}}, p. 451, note 18</ref>}}\n\nIn sum, earlier and rejected names during the composition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' were ''Finduilas'', ''Rhien'', ''Galdrin'', ''Galdrien'', ''Galadhrien'', and ''Galadrien''.<ref>{{TI|Index}}, p. 480, entry \"Galadriel\"</ref>\n\n===Expanding the First Age===\nIn the [[Appendix F]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien had already stated that Galadriel was \"of the royal house of Finrod, father of Felagund, Lord of Nargothrond\" (in the Second Edition, Tolkien changed the names to ''Finarfin'' and ''Finrod Felagund'', respectively). Although not using much detail, Tolkien was thus introducing Galadriel in \"The Silmarillion\" tradition, and having finished ''The Lord of the Rings'', he began the work of expanding the backstory of the character. Galadriel enters this tradition in the ''[[Annals of Aman]]'', in which she is first mentioned when Tolkien decided the children of Finrod (later Finarfin) would be related to Thingol through Eärwen.<ref>{{MR|P2l}}, p. 104, §85</ref> In the ''Annals'', written after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'',<ref>{{MR|P2}}, p. 48</ref> Galadriel stands out by being valiant and the only woman leading the Exile of the Noldor,<ref>{{AA|§135, 163}}</ref> but there is no explanation of the nature of her rebellion or its later impact on her life.\n\nIndeed, [[Christopher Tolkien]] explains that when the chapter \"Farewell to Lórien\" was written, his father had not conceived the idea of a ban upon Galadriel's return due to her role in the Flight of the Noldor.<ref name=\"History\">{{UT|6}}, pp. 228-9</ref> In a letter from [[1953]] (even before ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published), Tolkien did not object to the comparison of Galadriel with the [[Virgin Mary]],<ref>{{L|142}}, p. 172</ref> [[#Rebel exile|a comparison he would object]] to later. \n\nWritten in the same years, the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' follow the ''Annals of Aman'', telling the chronology of Beleriand, mainly after the Return of the Noldor. Here Galadriel's rol is briefly expanded, limited to her relation with Melian and a conversation with her brother Finrod.<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, pp. 35, 40-2, 44, 50</ref> The darkness pending upon all the Noldor is explicitly mentioned, but the same happens with the innocence of the children of Finrod (later Finarfin) during the discussions with Thingol and Melian. Sadly, Tolkien left these ''Annals'' unfinished at the point of the [[Wanderings of Húrin]], so nothing is told about Galadriel at the end of the First Age, neither about her relation with Celeborn.<ref group=\"note\">Notice that both ''Annals'' were (on the matter of Galadriel) the source used by Christopher Tolkien for his edition of the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''. For more details see ''[[#The published Silmarillion]]''.</ref>\n\n===Expanding the Second Age===\nAfter the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien most expanded the story of Galadriel in the Second Age in \"[[Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn]]\". This manuscript is the only full narrative dealing with this matter, but sadly it is a stub full of corrections, and Tolkien never solved some contradictions that would be raised later.<ref group=\"note\">Notice that this text is the main source for the \"[[#Second Age|Second Age]]\" section of this article, in which the contradictions have been deliberately overlooked. For more details see ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref> Christopher comments that what is now remarkable is that there is still no presence of the idea of a ban upon Galadriel's return: she stays in Middle-earth out of her love for Celeborn. There could be some pride on her part, as she was eager to visit Middle-earth, but later she stays in Eriador after the first fall of Sauron as a sort of duty until he was finally defeated.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|233–4}}\n\nThe first clear mention of pride in Galadriel's decision is probably in one of many manuscripts written c. [[1959]] dealing with Elven growing. In this text it is briefly mentioned that Galadriel rejected coming back to the West and live in [[Eressëa]], moved by her love for Celeborn and (told in a footnote) maybe by her pride, as she had lived in Aman as a princess, so the Lonely Isle would be a \"second best\".<ref name=\"Scales\" /> We see here that she was allowed to return to the West, but limited to Eressëa, far from the blessed lands (this is, Valinor and Eldamar). There is a sort of ban, not particularly against her, but her pride stands out, as it will become in an essential aspect of her character in the following \"phase\" of her development.\n\n===Rebel exile===\nIn mid-[[1967]], Tolkien wrote long drafts of a letter, in which he first mentioned the idea of Galadriel not being allowed to return after the First Age as a punishment for being one of the leaders of the Noldor rebellion. Also, in a footnote, he interprets the ''[[Namárië]]'' as Galadriel's wish that Frodo might go West, as she cannot, believing she is to remain in Middle-earth forever. And more radically, Tolkien interprets the test of the Ring as granting Galadriel permission to return to Aman.<ref name=\"L|297\" /> Christopher Tolkien does not believe that this letter is proof that the ban was present when such passages were written.<ref name=\"History\" /> Given all this, we can well affirm that what is said in this letter are reinterpretations made a posteriori.\n\nJust two months later, ''[[The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle]]'' was published in the United States, in which Tolkien included a brief biography of Galadriel in notes to the ''Namárië''. Not only the Elvish poem, but the line \"''What ship will carry me again across such a wide sea?''\" of the poem mentioned above, are interpreted here as expressions of Galadriel's longing, unable to return to the West. Her arrogance is connected to her rebellious role, since she replied proudly to the prohibition by saying she had no desire to return.<ref name=\"RGEO\" />\n\nIt is strange that Tolkien's new vision was so clear at this time, since there does not seem to be any intermediate text in which he considered this version or others. Now, he would go ahead with this vision, so it would also affect the character's background in the First Age.\n\nWritten in [[1968]] or later, ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'' includes a long passage about Galadriel during her life in Aman and during the Exile. It is the first place that highlights her enmity with Fëanor before the Exile, and also her independence from him, since her desire to see and rule distant lands was already present in her before Fëanor's speech. Her role during the Flight of the Noldor is described as courageous and blameless: she had a legitimate desire to help her Teleri kin in Middle-earth, and she fought fiercely against Fëanor in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. However, she is guilty of pride, not only in her departure, as here she is granted forgiveness after Morgoth's defeat, but she rejects it.<ref name=\"Case\" />\n\nA few years later, in [[1971]], we see that this conception of Galadriel still remains. In response to a letter, Tolkien acknowledges the influence of the figure of the Virgin Mary on the character of Galadriel, but now points out a radical difference: Galadriel was a penitent with a past marked by pride and rebellion against divine authorities.<ref>{{L|320}}, p. 407</ref>\n\n===Unstained exile===\nIn a letter written in August [[1973]] (one month before his death), Tolkien gave a completely different description of Galadriel: \n\n{{blockquote|Galadriel was 'unstained': she had committed no evil deeds. She was an enemy of Fëanor. She did not reach Middle-earth with the other Noldor, but independently. Her reasons for desiring to go to Middle-earth were legitimate, and she would have been permitted to depart, but for the misfortune that before she set out the revolt of Fëanor broke out, and she became involved in the desperate measures of Manwë, and the ban on all emigrations.<ref>{{L|353}}, p. 431</ref>}}\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Artanis sketch.jpg|thumb|''Artanis'' by [[:Category:Images by Elena Kukanova|Elena Kukanova]]]]\nThis was not an isolated idea; around the same time he wrote an outline of the revised backstory of Galadriel, which he could not carry into narrative, as it ended up being probably his last writing related to the legendarium. Here Galadriel is described as totally opposed to Fëanor from the beginning, and she felt confined in Aman and desired to depart to Middle-earth in order to exercise her talents: \"for being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the Valar thought fit to give the Eldar\". Manwë was probably aware of her desire and he had not forbidden her to depart, nor given permission yet. Nonetheless, Galadriel did not remain inactive and thought in the ships of the Teleri, so she dwelt in Alqualondë with her mother's kin. There she met Celeborn (here a Telerin prince and her cousin), and both planned to build a boat and seek the permission of the Valar to depart to Middle-earth. \n\nBut then Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the [[Two Trees]], and Fëanor began his rebellion, in which Galadriel had no part. \"Indeed, she and Celeborn fought heroically in defence of Alqualondë against the assault of the Noldor, and Celeborn's ship was saved from them\". Now Galadriel sailed in despair without asking Manwë, and indeed she would have been told to stay in Valinor in that hour, despite her desire being legitimate; and thus the ban against departure fell upon her and she was forbidden to return. She and Celeborn reached Middle-earth before Fëanor, finding Círdan's haven and being received with joy. They did not join the war against Morgoth, which they considered hopeless without the help of the Valar, and instead they recommended going eastwards and befriending the [[Dark Elves]] and Men living there. But the Elves of Beleriand did not heed these counsels, so both of them crossed the Ered Lindon before the end of the First Age. They were granted permission to return by the Valar, but they rejected it.\n\nChristopher Tolkien explains that this change probably had its roots in the philosophical implications of Galadriel's power in Middle-earth. He is certain that his father had the intention of changing all the narrative of \"The Silmarillion\" related to the backstory of Galadriel, despite what was already written: after all, she was not part of the story of the Noldor in the first place and the book had not been published. The only notable problem is in the backstory of Celeborn, which contradicts what was already published in J.R.R. Tolkien's life.<ref name=\"History\" />{{rp|231–3}}\n\n===Unsolved contradictions===\nAs can be seen, the development of Galadriel throughout Tolkien's texts is mainly structured around the nature of her exile and ban from Aman. In this subsection we present other aspects of her that are better explained separately for order's sake. In the mentioned texts there are some loose contradictions that can be easily explained as mere mistakes. A noticeable case is Galadriel using [[Nenya]] during the Second Age in \"[[Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn]]\", which contradicts everything we know about the [[Rings of Power]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''. On the contrary, the contradictions presented in this subsection result from the several revisions and we cannot know how Tolkien would have solved them.\n\n;:Galadriel in Nargothrond\nIn the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' it is written that Galadriel went from Doriath to Nargothrond \"and dwelt there for a while\" after Finrod had completed its building.<ref name=\"Nargothrond\" /> But while expanding the ''[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Tolkien wrote: \"Yet Galadriel his sister went never to Nargothrond, for she remained long in Doriath\", and revised it with \"Yet Galaðriel his sister dwelt never in Nargothrond\".<ref>{{WJ|10}}, p. 178</ref> It is unclear which version was written as definitive, but Christopher Tolkien chose the former one for [[Of the Noldor in Beleriand|Chapter 15]] of his edition of ''The Silmarillion''.\n\n;:Passing over the mountains\nChristopher Tolkien explains that in the first conception, Galadriel went to the east from Beleriand alone and found Celeborn (probably of [[Nandor]]in origin) in Lórien. Hence in the chapter \"[[The Mirror of Galadriel]]\" she said Celeborn dwelt in the West before the Dawn, and that she crossed the mountains from Beleriand (apparently alone). This contradicts the information in [[Appendix B]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'', in which Celeborn is a Sinda who accompanied Galadriel from Lindon.<ref name=\"History\" />{{rp|228}}\n\nThe time when she passed over the mountains is also contradictory, as Galadriel said that it was \"''ere the fall of Nargothrond and Gondolin''\", yet in Appendix B it is stated that at the beginning of the Second Age she was still dwelling in Lindon, before passing over the mountains. This contradiction in the same work must have been due to a mistake during revision.<ref group=\"note\">It is possible, however, that Galadriel first left Beleriand to avoid the cataclysmic war, later came to Lindon to join the surviving exiles, and crossed the Ered Luin again looking for a settlement.</ref>\n\n;:Marriage of Galadriel and Celeborn\nIn Appendix B, while describing the beginning of the Second Age, it is said that Celeborn dwelt in [[Harlindon|south Lindon]] with his wife Galadriel, so it appears that they were married at this point.<ref name=\"Second\" /> In a manuscript from c. [[1959]], Tolkien said that Galadriel and Celeborn probably married \"soon after the overthrow of Morgoth\", before they crossed the Mountains.<ref name=\"Scales\" /> Another manuscript from the same period states the same, but in its following notes Tolkien wrote that Galadriel did not marry Celeborn until they were settled (in Lake Nenuial, as understood by the context).<ref>{{NM|P1x}}, p. 73</ref> In a manuscript from [[1965]], while Tolkien pondered about Amroth being their child, he wrote that Galadriel and Celeborn were betrothed, but did not marry until the confusion of the War of Wrath and the beginning of the Second Age had ended (till S.A. 24).<ref name=\"Ages\" />\n\n;:Birth-year of Celebrían\nThe year and the place of Celebrían's birth was never definite. Tolkien considered as early as year 9 of the Second Age, and as late as 350 (850 was also considered, but as a mere conjecture). For details and references see ''[[Celebrían#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.\n\n;:Mother of Amroth\nIn \"Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn\", both Celebrían and [[Amroth]] are children of Galadriel and Celeborn,<ref name=\"Concerning\" /> but in later texts dating from [[1969]], Tolkien made Amroth the son of [[Amdír]].<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 244</ref> For more details see ''[[Amroth#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.\n\n;:Founder of Eregion\nIn Appendix B, it is said that at the beginning of the Second Age, the Noldor went to [[Eregion]] out of their interest for the [[mithril]] in [[Moria]]. Besides, Celebrimbor is called \"Lord of Eregion\", with no mention of his relation with Galadriel.<ref name=\"Second\" /> In \"Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn\", Galadriel and Celeborn are described as the founders of Eregion, a place chosen by Galadriel out of her desire to gather the Elven and the Dwarvish races against the increasing evil in Middle-earth. Celebrimbor is the chief builder of the realm, but is not mentioned as its lord, although he later seizes the power there.<ref name=\"Concerning\" />{{rp|235–7}} Celebrimbor as the founder appears only in a linguistic work, in which Tolkien simply mentions \"the settlement at Eregion under Celebrimbor\".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 53</ref> It is unclear if these texts are necessarily contradictory, but it is clear that trying to explain the rule in Eregion remains problematic.\n\n===The published ''Silmarillion''===\nChristopher Tolkien was aware of his father's [[#Unstained exile|latest conception]], in which Galadriel left Aman free of any guilt. However, as this was a mere projected idea, he had to make use of the completed narratives for his edition of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', in which she is a rebel leader.<ref name=\"History\" />{{rp|232–3}} It is notable that in this work there is no explanation of Galadriel's reasons for remaining in Middle-earth after the War of Wrath, save that Celeborn was unwilling to leave,<ref name=\"Earendil\" /> nor is there any mention of a ban against her return or her concerns about the remaining evil. This way, Christopher did not choose any particular position and let the reader guess, but also stripped this character of all development in relation to ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\n[[Douglas C. Kane]] noted that Christopher Tolkien, for his edition, removed some statements on Galadriel from his father's work: [[Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië|Chapter 5]]'s original text said that Galadriel was \"the most valiant\" lady of the [[house of Finwë]]; and [[Of the Flight of the Noldor|Chapter 9]]'s mentioned her as \"Galadriel the valiant and fair\". According to Kane, Galadriel is not the only female character inexplicably diminished by Christopher's editorial choices.<ref>[[Douglas C.

Galadriel narrates the [[Prologue: One Ring to Rule Them All...|Prologue]], explaining the creation of the Rings of Power and the War of the Last Alliance. Earlier plans considered were to have either Frodo or Gandalf narrate the Prologue, but this was dropped: Frodo was not alive until thousands of years after these events happened, and although Gandalf was alive, he was not present in Middle-earth at the time; the Wizards came some one thousand years after the Prologue ends. Thus Galadriel narrates the Prologue, because she had first-hand accounts of this history and actively participated in its events.\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:Galadriel frequently consults [[ósanwë|telepathically]] with Elrond; in the books there is no clear indication of how Galadriel knew about the coming of the Fellowship. In the film, unlike the book, Galadriel and [[Elrond]] send an army of [[Elves]] - led by [[Haldir]] - to [[Battle of the Hornburg|Helm's Deep]] to aid the [[Rohirrim]]. In the DVD commentary, [[Peter Jackson]] and his fellow writers explain that they worried audiences would wonder why the Elves do not seem to be helping in the war, while at the same time, they felt that actually inserting an entire separate battle scene at Lothlórien would take up too much screen time and resources.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:A spiritual apparition of Lady Galadriel appears to provide Frodo strength following his passage through Shelob's Lair soon after he uses the Phial that she gave him. She is later seen leaving Middle-earth along with other Ring-bearers, but in film version her husband Celeborn departs with her at the same time.\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Cate Blanchett reprised her role as Galadriel, although the character is absent from the novel.<ref name=\"PJCasting\">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168211921558|articlename=Production begins in New Zealand on The Hobbit|dated=20-March-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> She appears as part of the [[White Council]] alongside [[Saruman]], [[Gandalf]] and [[Elrond]]. Later, right before [[Thorin and Company|Thorin and his Company]] enter in [[Mirkwood]], she telepathically urges Gandalf to further seek the true identity of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]. Finally, during the [[attack on Dol Guldur]], Galadriel plays a larger role. She first rescues Gandalf from captivity, and is ultimately the one to drive Sauron from the fortress using her [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]], although weakened by the amount of power she used.\n\n===Television===\n'''1993: [[Hobitit]]:'''\n:Galadriel is portrayed by [[Heidi Krohn]].

Norisová also provides most of the singing in the series (including the opening and closing titles theme and series closing song), alluding to Galadriel being a secondary storyteller (with Bilbo Baggins serving as the series' primary storyteller).\n\n===Games===\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Galadriel, voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]], is the narrator of the Prologue and the Epilogue, and appears in Lothlórien.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Galadriel is the strongest of \"Hero\" units available to the Free Peoples. If a player's army manages to spot [[Gollum]] on the battlefield, take The One Ring from him and deliver it to their forces, the option to \"summon\" Galadriel unlocks for a large amount of resources. Thus, Lady Galadriel is represented as succumbing to corruption of The Ring, similar to the respective scene in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' movie.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria]]'', Galadriel plays a prominent role during the Epic storyline with guidance and support. During the final days of the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel assembles the Council of Elven Lords, where it is decided to bring their armies against [[Dol Guldur]]. After she brings down the walls of Dol Guldur, Galadriel accompanies Arwen on her journey south to her wedding, and they visit the site of [[Celebrian]]'s captivity in the [[Misty Mountains]] together. Afterwards, she and Celeborn join the procession of [[Elrond]]'s house and travel to [[Minas Tirith]] to attend the wedding of Arwen and Aragorn.\n\n'''2014: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''\n:Galadriel is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character.

He was the twin brother of [[Elros]], who later became the first king of [[Númenor]].<ref name=\"Earendil\">{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\nHaving been born in [[Beleriand]] towards the end of the [[First Age]], Elrond ever opposed [[Sauron]] and strove against him throughout the [[Second Age]], helping to bring about Sauron's defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] as [[Gil-galad]]'s herald. Elrond inherited Gil-galad's Elven ring [[Vilya]], and during the [[Third Age]] he fought against the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] and, as a member of the [[White Council]], expelled the Necromancer from [[Dol Guldur]] (who was Sauron in another guise). Towards the end of the Third Age, he was the foster-father to [[Aragorn]] as he had been to Arathorn before him. Aragorn went on to marry Elrond's daughter Arwen. After the destruction of [[the One Ring]], Elrond sailed west with [[Gandalf]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and [[Galadriel]]; their passing marked the end of the Third Age and the beginning of the [[Fourth Age|Fourth]].\n\nElrond is one of the most prominent, significant and recognisable characters in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s legendarium, appearing in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. He was critical to providing [[Thorin and Company]] with the information they needed to enter the [[Lonely Mountain]], and the [[Council of Elrond]] brought about the creation of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], which ultimately resulted in the destruction of the One Ring and the final defeat of Sauron.\n\n==History==\n===First Age===\nElros and Elrond were born in the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] during the darkest days of the First Age, when the forces of [[Morgoth]] controlled most of [[Beleriand]]. When the twins were just six years old, the [[Sons of Fëanor]], bound by their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], assaulted the Havens in the [[Third Kinslaying]], since they desired the [[Silmaril]] on the [[Nauglamír]] held by Elwing. Eärendil was at sea, and Elwing escaped with the Nauglamír and jumped into the sea.<ref name=\"Earendil\" /> [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], the only Sons of Fëanor to survive the assault upon the Havens, took Elros and Elrond as captives<ref name=\"Earendil\" /> and abandoned them in a cave with a fall of water over the entrance instead of killing them.<ref name=\"L211\">{{L|211}}, answer to Question 4</ref> But Maglor took pity upon Elrond and Elros and rescued them, and a mutual love grew between Maglor and the young twins afterwards.<ref name=\"Earendil\" /> Elrond was given the name \"Elf of the cavern\" or \"star-dome\" (see [[#Etymology|Etymology]]), because Elrond was found in the cave.<ref name=\"L211\" />\n[[File:Tuuliky - Little Half-elf.jpg|thumb|left|Maglor raises Elrond. Art by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[War of Wrath]], because of his Half-elven heritage, the [[Valar]] gave Elrond and his brother a choice to be counted among the kindred of Elves or Men. Elrond chose to belong to the [[Firstborn]], while Elros chose to become mortal.<ref name=\"Earendil\" /> Elros voyaged over the sea to Númenor following the star of Eärendil;<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> whereas Elrond remained among the Elves and carried on the lineage of King [[Elwë]].<ref>{{PM|XII}}</ref> Elrond subsequently remained in [[Lindon]] with [[Gil-galad]], where he became known as a healer and lore-master.\n\n===Second Age===\nA fair being calling himself [[Annatar]], emissary of the Valar, came seeking entrance to Lindon during the Second Age. Elrond and Gil-galad sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him. They were correct, as proven in the later [[War of the Elves and Sauron]]. \n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Gil-galad sends Elrond to aid Celebrimbor.jpg|thumb|''Gil-galad sends Elrond to aid Celebrimbor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nIn {{SA|1695}}, Gil-galad sent Elrond to aid Eregion. Elrond's forces came too late and proved too small to defend Eregion. While Sauron sent most of his army west to attack Lindon, he left a strong detachment behind to contain Elrond. In [[Second Age 1697|two years]], Eregion [[Sack of Eregion|was laid waste]] and Elrond, along with the surviving Noldor, ran the risk of being overun, when [[Dwarves|Durin's folk]] of [[Khazad-dûm]] attacked Sauron's rear guard, turning Sauron's attention to these new foes. This allows Elrond and the remaining Noldor to flee far north. There, he established the stronghold of [[Rivendell|Imladris]].<ref name=\"UTC\">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref><ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>\n\nMany more refugees joined Elrond's host as Sauron ravaged Eriador during the course of the war. By {{SA|1700}}, Imladris, despite being [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged]], was the only part of [[Eriador]] not under Sauron's control. It was liberated by [[Gil-galad]]'s and [[Tar-Minastir]]'s forces. After Sauron's defeat, a Council was held at that time, establishing that Imladris should be maintained as an Elvish stronghold, and appointing Elrond as Gil-galad's vice-regent in Eriador, passing the Ring [[Vilya]] to him.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>\n\nElrond marched with Gil-galad and [[Elendil]] during the [[War of the Last Alliance]], serving as Gil-galad’s herald. He was present during the [[Battle of Dagorlad|last battle]] of that war, witnessing the deaths of Gil-galad and Elendil. When [[Isildur]] cut [[the One Ring]] from Sauron’s hand at the conclusion of the battle, he and [[Círdan]] advised Isildur to destroy the Ring, but Isildur refused their counsel. Elrond subsequently returned to Rivendell, which prospered in the coming years with the aid of the Ring of Air, [[Vilya]], that Elrond had received from Gil-galad. \n\nIt has been argued that, following Gil-galad’s death, Elrond had the right to become High King of the Noldor, but he never claimed the title. Indeed, after the Second Age ended, there were very few Noldor left in Middle-earth for there to be a king over.{{fact}}\n\n===Third Age===\nFollowing Isildur's death, Elrond received the shards of [[Narsil]], which he preserved for many years. He began his long tradition of fostering the heirs of Isildur by helping to raise Isildur's son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], who had been left in Rivendell during the War of the Last Alliance. \n\nIn {{TA|109}}, Elrond married [[Celebrían]], the daughter of [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]]. Their first children, the twins [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], were born in {{TA|130|n}}, and their daughter [[Arwen]] in {{TA|241|n}}.<ref name=\"AppB2\" /> \n\nDuring the late reign of [[Arveleg I]], [[Second Siege of Imladris|Rivendell was besieged by Angmar]]. After an incursion by [[Angmar]] into Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the Elvenfolk of Rivendell joined those of Lindon in subduing the power of the [[Witch-king]] for many years.<ref name=\"North\">{{App|North}}</ref>\n\nCenturies later, when the Northern Kingdom fell, Elrond took the other heirlooms of Arnor (the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] and the [[Ring of Barahir]]) into his keeping, holding them for the one who would eventually be able to reclaim the throne of [[Arnor]].\n\nElrond, along with others of the [[Wise]], was joined by the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]], who was sent by the Valar from the West. As they decided, Gandalf invaded [[Dol Guldur]]. The Necromancer withdrew and the [[Watchful Peace]] began. In {{TA|2463}}, the Wise formed the [[White Council]] with the Wizard [[Saruman]] as its head.\n[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Dol Guldur'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]\nElrond was later separated from his wife when she was taken by [[Orcs]]. Their sons rescued her, but Elrond was unable to heal her mentally, and she decided to leave for the [[Uttermost West|West]] in {{TA|2510|n}}.\n\nIn {{TA|2851}}, the White Council met to decide whether to act on Gandalf's discovery of the identity of the [[Necromancer]] as Sauron, but [[Saruman]] dissuaded the others from acting upon Gandalf's revelation.\n\nIn {{TA|2933}}, Elrond took [[Aragorn]] as his foster-son in Rivendell, and had Arwen live in [[Lothlórien]] with her grandmother.\n\nElrond named Aragorn ''[[Estel]]'' (\"Hope\") and concealed his heritage from him until he came of age. When Aragorn became an adult, Elrond gave him the [[Ring of Barahir]] and the shards of Narsil, foreseeing that Aragorn might be the one to claim the thrones of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]]. When Aragorn fell in love with Arwen, Elrond revealed to him that Arwen shared the choice of the Half-elven, and that one or the other of them would ultimately be parted from her forever. Elrond insisted that Arwen could not marry Aragorn until he became king of both Gondor and Arnor.\n[[File:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Elrond and Thrór's Map.jpg|thumb|Elrond examines [[Thrór's Map]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'']]\nIn {{TA|2941}}, Elrond welcomed [[Thorin and Company]] into his home, the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]] before the wild. On Midsummer's Eve - the night before the [[Dwarves]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and [[Gandalf]] continued on their journey eastward - Elrond examined the swords which they had found in the trolls' cave. He read the runes and revealed that [[Thorin|Thorin's]] sword was called [[Orcrist]], the \"Goblin-cleaver\", and that Gandalf's sword was named [[Glamdring]], the \"Foe-hammer\". He told them that they were [[Elves|Elven]] swords from the ancient city of [[Gondolin]], destroyed long ago. He then looked at [[Thrór's Map]] and found that there were [[moon-letters]]. From the moon of that midsummer's eve he could read the words: 'five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' and 'stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole'. This information proved vital for Bilbo and the Dwarves to enter the [[Lonely Mountain]] through its secret entrance.<ref name=\"H3\">{{H|3}}</ref>\n\nDuring that same year, the [[White Council]] assailed [[Dol Guldur]] and rid [[Mirkwood]] of the Necromancer's presence.<ref name=\"AppB2\">{{App|B2}}</ref> Upon Bilbo and Gandalf's return to Rivendell, Elrond and the grey wizard discussed this and the events of the Lonely Mountain.

Saruman quieted him, insisting that the Ring had been swept out to sea.\n\n====War of the Ring====\nWhen [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] first left the Shire with the One Ring, it was always his intention to go to Rivendell to seek the advice of Elrond. Indeed, in his letter left at Bree, Gandalf counselled him to do so. After Elrond healed Frodo of his wound sustained at [[Weathertop]], he then hosted the feast that was held when Frodo recovered.\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Glorfindel returns to Rivendell.jpg|thumb|left|''Glorfindel returns to Rivendell'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\nElrond presided at the [[Council of Elrond]]. During that meeting, he narrated what he knew of the history of Isildur and the Ring. He identified Aragorn as the [[Heir of Isildur]], and when Frodo ultimately volunteered to carry the Ring, Elrond affirmed that decision. Elrond also appeared to have selected the members of the Fellowship other than Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], despite accepting [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] only reluctantly.\n\nLater, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir to join the [[Dúnedain]] Rangers who rode to [[Rohan]] to join Aragorn. Through Elrohir, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. During the [[Last Debate]], Elrohir supported Aragorn’s decision to attack Mordor as a diversion to allow Frodo time to reach Mount Doom, saying that this was Elrond’s advice. \n\nAfter the passing of [[Sauron]], Aragorn was crowned as [[King of the West|King]] of the new [[Reunited Kingdom]] on [[1 May]], and according to his own promise Elrond escorted Arwen to [[Lothlórien]]. They arrived on [[20 May]] and Arwen went to [[Minas Tirith]] to wed Aragorn.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> He parted from her in great sorrow.\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Departure at the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|''Departure at the Grey Havens'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nElrond was one of the Elves who took the [[White Ship]] to [[Valinor]] along with Frodo, Gandalf, and the other [[Ring-bearers]]. The Third Age's end is marked by their departure.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Quote|He was as noble and fair as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', \"[[A Short Rest]]\"}}\nElrond seemed ageless, resembling neither old nor young. However, one could see in his face the memories and experiences of thousands of years. He looked venerable both like an old king, a wise wizard, and an experienced warrior in his prime.\n\nElrond is described as dark-haired, while his eyes were grey, shining like starlight. He could be seen wearing a circlet of silver.<ref name=\"meetings\" /><ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>\n\nHis parents were [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]]. He was thus [[Half-elven]]: Eärendil was the child of the mortal [[Tuor]] and the elf [[Idril]], while Elwing was the grandchild of [[Beren]] (a [[Man]]) and [[Lúthien]] (daughter of the Elf-king [[Thingol]] and the Maia [[Melian]]). Consequently, Elrond was descended from all three tribes of the Elves ([[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] through Idril, [[Sindar]] through Lúthien), a Maia, and all three houses of the [[Edain]] ([[House of Hador|Hador]], [[House of Haleth|Haleth]] and [[House of Bëor|Bëor]]).\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Elrond.mp3|Ardamir}}\nIn a letter from 1958, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] explained that ''Elrond'' is a [[Sindarin]] name that he was given because he was found in a cave, and that the name is a compound of ''eld>ell'', the Sindarin term for the High-Elven exiles, and ''rond'' based on primitive Elvish ''rondo'' meaning \"cavern\".<ref name=\"L211\" /> In an essay that was probably written between 1959 and 1960, J.R.R.

There he is mentioned to be the son of [[Eärendel]], heir of the [[House of Hador]], who because of his mortal blood chose to remain in the [[Great Lands]] and became the leader of the Elves in the remnant of [[Beleriand]]. There he allied with the Faithful [[Amroth]] (a precursor of Elendil) against [[Sûr]] (Sauron).<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}</ref> In a rewrite of the same text, Elrond becomes the first [[King of Númenor]] instead, the builder of the city of Númenos, and is a mortal (which means that the text was likely written before ''The Hobbit'', as he appears alive there). It is Gil-galad who fights Sauron. With the conception of Elros, Tolkien added a later note that considered making Elrond stay with Gil-galad or return to Middle-earth.<ref>{{LR|P1II3}}</ref>\n\nElrond was then \"borrowed\" or imported into ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Subsequently he, along with [[Gandalf]], became one of the only characters to appear in all three of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn the chapter \"[[A Short Rest]]\" of ''The Hobbit'', it is said of Elrond that he \n{{blockquote|...was an elf-friend — one of those people whose fathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North.

In the subsequent fleshing out of his background, it is never mentioned that he was ever the \"chief\" of the people who came from \"both elves and heroes of the North\" (which would apply to the [[Half-elven]] or rather the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]).\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Elrond in Adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Sagan om Ringen - Elrond.png|Elrond as portrayed in ''[[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|Sagan om Ringen]]''\nFile:The Hobbit (1977 film) - Elrond.jpg|Elrond as portrayed in [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Elrond.jpg|Elrond as portrayed in [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Elrond2.jpg|[[Hugo Weaving]] as Elrond in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Elrond.jpg|Elrond in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Elrond in LOTR- War in the North-1.png|Elrond in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''\nFile:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Elrond.jpg|[[Robert Aramayo]] as Elrond in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' series\n</gallery>\n===Films===\n'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''\n:Elrond is given the title 'alvkungen', which translates to 'Elf king'. After [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo’s]] recovery from the [[Morgul-wound]], those present at [[Rivendell]] hold a feast in celebration. The [[Council of Elrond]] convenes the next day and Elrond talks of the [[Elves]] battles against [[Sauron]]. Frodo asks how he can remember this, noting that [[Gil-galad]] died over three thousand years ago. Elrond tells Frodo that he has lived in [[Middle-earth]] for Three [[Ages]] and that he was present for the [[Siege of Barad-dûr|defeat of Sauron]] and watched as [[Isildur]] cut [[The One Ring]] from Sauron’s hand and took the Ring for himself. After [[Gandalf]] tells of how he escaped from [[Saruman]], Elrond tells the Council of their chief goal: Bring the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it in the fire in which it was created. Elrond reminds them that destroying the Ring would bring peace for all of Middle-earth and that it is imperative that they put their lives on the line to bring about peace. After the members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] are decided and they begin to prepare for their journey, Elrond farewells Gandalf and wishes him luck on their quest. \n\n'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''\n:Elrond appears in [[Rivendell]], crowned with a ring of stars. He feeds the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]], and identifies [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]]. He needs little time to identify the latter. He is shown with a beard, although Tolkien clearly states [[Elves]] do not have beards. His voice was provided by [[Cyril Ritchard]].\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:Elrond, voiced by [[André Morell]], appears at the [[Council of Elrond]]. He sits on a raised chair, and narrates the scene. Not until [[the One Ring]] is brought forward does he take an active part.\n\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:Elrond appears roughly the same as in the first of [[Rankin/Bass]]' films. The premise of the film, a [[minstrel of Gondor]] who tells the tale of \"Frodo of the Nine Fingers, and the Ring of Doom\" at [[Bilbo Baggins]]' 129th birthday party in Rivendell, allows Elrond to be a member of the audience, and then sails west, with [[Gandalf]] and the two allowed Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins]] (his nephew) come because of their service in Middle-earth and being friends. Because Cyril Ritchard had passed away not long after completing his work on ''The Hobbit'', Rankin/Bass regular [[Paul Frees]] took over as his voice.\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Elrond, played by [[Hugo Weaving]], first appears in the prologue as a commander of the army of [[Gil-galad]] in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. A later flashback scene shows him actually taking [[Isildur]] into [[Mount Doom]], trying to persuade him to destroy the Ring. [[Círdan]] is omitted.\n\n:As in the book, Elrond heals [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s wound from [[Weathertop]]. Elrond then has a conversation with [[Gandalf]], discussing the many challenges that face them. Elrond argues that the Ring cannot remain in Rivendell (in the film, Frodo appears to have thought that he would be able to leave the Ring there). He also expresses his doubts about the race of [[Men]], and gives the first hints about [[Aragorn]]'s real identity. In the Council of Elrond, Elrond himself is the one who argues that the only option is to destroy the Ring. He does not select the Fellowship, but accepts those who volunteer.\n\n:Elrond gains two additional scenes in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the movie. In the first, he talks with Aragorn beside the grave of Aragorn’s mother. Elrond encourages the reluctant Aragorn to accept his fate of becoming [[Kings of Gondor|king]]. In the next scene, Elrond blesses the departing [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]].\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:Though he had no scenes in the book, Elrond appears mainly in conversations with [[Arwen]], whose role is also greatly expanded. In a flashback, Aragorn remembers Elrond telling him to abandon his love for Arwen, allowing her to sail to [[Valinor]]. Aragorn attempts to do this, but Arwen denies him. In another scene, Elrond persuades Arwen that she should sail to Valinor, describing what will happen if she remains and Aragorn dies. Elrond then has a [[ósanwe|telepathic]] communication with [[Galadriel]] discussing the [[War of the Ring|war]] that is about to start. He apparently suggests that she send an army to [[Helm's Deep]] to aid the [[Rohirrim|Men]] there, since when [[Haldir]] arrives at Helm's Deep he says that he brings \"word from Elrond of Rivendell.\"\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:In the final installment of Jackson's film series, Elrond's first scene is with Arwen, who has decided not to sail after all, but to return. Although he senses that she is dying, Elrond acknowledges her choice. At her suggestion, he has the [[shards of Narsil]] [[Andúril|re-forged]], then carries the new sword to Aragorn at [[Dunharrow]]. He finally convinces Aragorn to accept his destiny, and advises him to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Later, Elrond escorts Arwen to [[Minas Tirith]] for [[Aragorn]]'s coronation, and he finally sails to Valinor with the [[Ring-bearers]].\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Hugo Weaving reprises the role of Elrond.<ref name=\"IMCasting\">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another Wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> As in the book, he identifies Gandalf's and [[Thorin]]'s respective swords, as well as translating the [[Moon-letters|runes]] on Thorin's [[Thrór's Map|map]] in the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|first]] film.

However, he is clearly alarmed by Gandalf's revealing of the [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]] from [[Dol Guldur]].

She was the daughter of [[Elrond]] and [[Celebrían]].<ref name=\"Tale\" />\n\nShe was considered to be the fairest of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] in the [[Third Age]], resembling [[Lúthien]] of the [[First Age]] who would never again appear in [[Ëa]]. Her romance with [[Aragorn]] was reminiscent of that between the Man [[Beren]] and the Elf Lúthien.  Like Lúthien, she rejected her [[Elves|Elven]] immortality to marry Aragorn and die with him.<ref name=\"Tale\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Anna Lee - Evenstar.jpg|thumb|left|''Evenstar'' by [[Anna Lee]]]]\n\nArwen was born in {{TA|241}} and was the younger sister of [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]].<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> From her mother she inherited the [[Elfstone]].<ref name=\"CG\">{{UT|6}}</ref> As one of the half-elven, she shared the right of her father to choose her fate.

The young [[Dúnadan]] fell in love when he first saw her, though as he was still a youth, Arwen did not return his love.<ref name=\"Tale\" /><ref name=\"TA\" />\n\nElrond insisted that Arwen could not marry Aragorn until he became king of both [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]]. Whether Arwen chose to marry him and become mortal, or remain with her kin as one of the Elves, she would be parted from either Elrond or Aragorn forever.<ref name=\"Tale\" /> \n[[File:Abe Papakhian - Lord of Rivendell.jpg|left|thumb|Arwen in Rivendell, art by [[:Category:Images by Abe Papakhian|Abe Papakhian]]]]\nIt was not until they met many years later in Lórien that Arwen returned Aragorn's love, and in {{TA|2980}} they plighted their troth on [[Cerin Amroth]]. Aragorn gave her the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref name=\"Tale\" /><ref name=\"TA\" />\n\nIn the years leading up to the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Misty Mountains]] and all lands eastward became dangerous, and at the request of her father, Arwen returned to Imladris in {{TA|3009}}.<ref name=\"TA\" />\n[[File:Janka Latečková - King and his Queen.jpg|thumb|right|''King and his Queen'' by Janka Latečková]]\nArwen was later reunited with Aragorn when he brought the [[Hobbits]] to [[Rivendell]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. She was present at a feast attended by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Later that night, she and Aragorn spoke together.<ref name=\"Many\" /> When the Fellowship departed and [[Galadriel]] offered them [[Gifts of Galadriel|her gifts]], Arwen's Elfstone, given from Galadriel to Celebrían, and Celebrían to Arwen, was the gift for Aragorn. He would wear the Elfstone ever after.<ref name=\"Farewell\">{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> This giving held the function of a wedding gift from the family of the bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen.<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}</ref>\n\nArwen wove the [[standard of Elendil]] for Aragorn from black cloth, decorating it with [[mithril]], gems and gold. She sent the banner with her brothers and a group of [[Rangers of the North]] to Aragorn before he took the [[Paths of the Dead]], thereby inspiring him to take the difficult path.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> The banner was unfurled at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to triumphantly announce the King's return.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - The Wedding of the King.jpg|thumb|\"The Wedding of [[Aragorn|the King]]\" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]\nAfter the defeat of [[Sauron]], Aragorn was crowned as [[King of the West]] and the new [[Reunited Kingdom]]; [[1 May|on that day]] Arwen and her father departed for [[Minas Tirith]]. On [[20 May]] they reached Lothlórien where they stayed for [[27 May|a week]] before Arwen resumed with her escort. On [[14 June]] she met her brothers and together they went to [[Edoras]] where they stayed [[16 June|two days]] before continuing to Gondor.<ref name=\"Chief\">{{App|Chief}}</ref> \n===Queen===\nArwen arrived to [[Minas Tirith]] on [[1 Lithe]] and wed Aragorn on [[Mid-year's Day]],<ref name=\"Chief\" /> being the third [[Unions of Elves and Men|union of Elves and Men]]. Arwen chose a fate different from her father's and did not sail to the [[Aman|West]]. Instead, she gifted Frodo, as the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], passage in her stead, as she foresaw that his burden would not be lifted. She also gifted him a necklace with a white gem.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\nAs Queen of Gondor, Arwen maintained a close connection with Gondor's allies, as did her husband. In {{FoA|15}} they visited the [[Hobbits]] outside [[the Shire]] and she took as a maid of honour [[Elanor Gardner]], daughter of [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> She was mother of one son, [[Eldarion]], and at least two unnamed daughters. After Aragorn's death, Arwen departed from Minas Tirith and returned to the abandoned Lothlórien. There she stayed for a time until she gave up her life in {{FoA|121}} at [[Cerin Amroth]], and was buried there.<ref name=\"Tale\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Arwen Undomiel.mp3|Ardamir}}\n'''''Arwen''''' means \"Noble Maiden\" in [[Sindarin]], from ''[[ara]]-'' (\"noble\") and ''[[gwenn]]'' (\"maiden\").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 205</ref> Tolkien remarked that it also means \"greatly blessed\" in [[Welsh]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], \"[[Letter to Mr Joukes|Letter to S.E.O. Joukes, 28 August 1967]]\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Quenya]] form of her name is not entirely certain, but in his Quenya greeting, Aragorn refers to her again as \"Arwen\" (''Arwen vanimelda, namárië!'').<ref name=\"Farewell\" /> This suggests that the form ''Arwen'' itself is also coincidentally a valid, or at least understandable, Quenya calque (using ''[[ar]]-'', stem ''Arwend-'').  \n\n==Other names==\nHer [[epessë]], '''''[[Undómiel]]''''', means \"Evenstar\", from ''[[Undómë]]'' (\"evening twilight\") and ''[[elen|el]]'' (\"star\").\n\nShe is also given the names ''Elrenniel'' and ''Elerondiel'', both meaning \"Daughter of Elrond\" in Sindarin and Quenya respectively.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 56</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\nArwen was a very distant cousin of Aragorn. By their marriage, the long-sundered lines of the [[Half-elven]] were joined.<ref name=\"Numenor\">{{App|A1i}}</ref> Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the kings of the three kindreds of the High Elves as well as the only line with [[Maia]] blood through Arwen's great-great grandmother, [[Melian]].\n\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| FIN |y| EAW | | GLN | | TUO |y| IDR | | DIO |y| NIM | |FIN=[[Finarfin]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1230}}''</small>|EAW=[[Eärwen]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|GLN=[[Galadhon]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>|TUO=[[Tuor]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|472}}''</small>|IDR=[[Idril]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|DIO=[[Dior]]<br /><small>''{{FA|470}} - {{FA|506|n}}''</small>|NIM=[[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|506}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | GAL |~|y|~| CEL | | | | EAR |~|~|y|~|~| ELW | | | |GAL=[[Galadriel]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1362}}''</small>|CEL=[[Celeborn]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>|EAR=[[Eärendil]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>|ELW=[[Elwing]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | CLB |~|~|~|y|~|~|~| ELR | | | ELS | | | | | | |CLB=[[Celebrían]]<br /><small>''b. {{SA|300}}''</small>|ELR=[[Elrond]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|532}}''</small>|ELS=[[Elros]]<br /><small>''{{FA|532}} - {{SA|442}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | | | |:| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | ELL | | ELO | | ARW |~|y|~| ARA | | | | | | |ELL=[[Elladan]]<br /><small>''b. {{TA|130}}''</small>|ELO=[[Elrohir]]<br /><small>''b. {{TA|130}}''</small>|ARW='''ARWEN'''<br /><small>''{{TA|241}} - {{FoA|121}}''</small>|ARA=[[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]<br /><small>''{{TA|2931}} - {{FoA|120}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | EDN | | DAU | | | | | | | |EDN=[[Eldarion]]<br /><small>''{{FoA|1}} - {{FoA|220|n}}''</small>|DAU=''unknown<br/>daughters''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nWhile writing the drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the character was named ''[[Finduilas]]''; only during the final proofreading in [[1949]] Tolkien changed the name to ''Arwen''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxviii</ref>\n\nTolkien considered to postpone the birth of Arwen from {{TA|241}} to {{TA|341}} , or even in {{TA|421}},<ref>{{NM|P1ix}}, p. 67.</ref> to increase the interval between the birth of the twins and the birth of Arwen where the parents were at rest, and he assigned the error in dates to a \"probable scribal origin\" (with the inversion of numbers 241/421).\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Arwen in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (film series) - Arwen 3.jpg|Arwen at the Ford of Bruinen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Arwen.JPG|Arwen in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Arwen.jpg|Arwen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:Arwen does not appear in this film.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Arwen is voiced by [[Sonia Fraser]].\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Arwen appears in Rivendell after the [[Council of Elrond]]. She has a brief dialogue with Aragorn, and recites several lines from the [[Riddle of Strider]]. No voice actress is specified, but it is likely [[Kath Soucie]].\n\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Arwen is played by [[Liv Tyler]]. Various additional scenes pertaining to Arwen are inserted, some of which deviate from the books and some of which seem to be inspired by ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''.\n\n:In the first film, she rescues [[Frodo Baggins]] from the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] at [[Bruinen]], thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. In the book, it was [[Glorfindel]] who put Frodo on horseback and sent him alone to flee the Black Riders, and Elrond and [[Gandalf]] arranged the flood. Also, in the book, Frodo defends himself against the Black Riders, whereas in the movie Arwen defends him.  Arwen wields the sword [[Hadhafang]],a non-canonical sword that belonged to her father.\n\n:There is a scene in which Aragorn has a dream about Arwen in which they kiss, a scene where Arwen has an argument with her father about leaving for [[Valinor]], and a scene where she actually departs for Valinor and then changes her mind and returns when she sees a vision of her future son, Eldarion.\n\n:In addition, towards the end of the cinematic trilogy she apparently becomes sick, seemingly as a result of her forsaking her immortality. Elrond takes the reforged [[Narsil]], now [[Andúril]], to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that her fate has become bound with [[the One Ring]], and that she is dying. However, no explanation is ever given for these statements. It is possible that Elrond's comments of her dying is simply a metaphor of her becoming mortal, and that he is not implying she has a connection with the Ring, but that Arwen's decision to stay means that her future, like the other free peoples of Middle-earth, now rests on the destruction of the ring. Later, after the Ring is destroyed, Arwen is present at Aragorn's coronation without any signs of illness.\n\n'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Arwen is provided by Slávka Halčáková. She only appears in person in the third series (season) of the adaptation, during the events of ''The Return of the King'', but is alluded to earlier.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Arwen can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from [[Rivendell]] into the Misty Mountains. Her roles in the game was initially small, and her only significant interaction with the player was the passing of Elessar's banner that she made for [[Aragorn]] and bid the player to deliver to [[Halbarad]]. After the downfall of [[Sauron]], her prominence increases as [[Elrond]] and his household travel to [[Minas Tirith]] for her wedding. On their way towards [[Lothlórien]] from the lands of the [[Beornings]], Arwen asks her father to visit the cave in which her mother [[Celebrian]] was tormented by [[orcs]] before being rescued. She later discusses that experience with Lady [[Galadriel]].\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Arwen resides in Rivendell, where players can discuss with her both historical and present subjects. While sporting the appearance of [[Liv Tyler]], her role is closer to the book than that in the movie: for example, she provides Halbarad and the Grey Company with the banner she had made for Aragorn, an event omitted from the movie adaptation. She is voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Fourth Age characters]]\n[[Category:Half-elven]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Arwen]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:elfes:semi-elfes:arwen]]\n[[fi:Arwen]]",

Coveting the power through which he would coordinate all things according to his own will, he joined with [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. As \"Gorthaur\" he became the most trusted lieutenant of Morgoth, being reckoned as the greatest of his allies and servants in the [[Battles of Beleriand|Wars of Beleriand]]. From his fortress of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], Sauron was directly responsible for the death of [[Barahir]] and later the [[Noldor]]in king [[Finrod]] during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]]. He demonstrated the ability to take the form of a wolf, a serpent, and a vampire.\n\nAfter the downfall of Morgoth, Sauron continually strove to conquer [[Middle-earth]] throughout the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age|Third]] Ages. In the Second Age, under the guise of '''Annatar''', he deceived the [[Elves]] of [[Eregion]], who under his guidance had created the [[Rings of Power]], whilst he secretly forged [[the One Ring]] in [[Mount Doom]]. Thus Sauron became \"'''[[Lord of the Ring|the Lord of the Rings]]'''\". Failing to corrupt the Elves, he assaulted the [[Westlands]], beginning a period called the [[Dark Years]], the first time he became known as the '''[[Dark Lord]]'''. The arrogant [[Númenóreans]], contesting their rule on Middle-earth, challenged him, and Sauron accepted to be brought to [[Númenor]] as a captive; however his influence corrupted the Númenóreans further - leading to the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. His spirit escaped, as did [[Elendil]] and his sons, founding the Realms in Exile of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. Elves and the [[Dúnedain]], formed the [[Last Alliance]] and, in {{SA|3441}}, Elendil and Elven [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Gil-galad]] died fighting Sauron. Following Sauron's defeat, Elendil's son, [[Isildur]], severed his Ringed finger and took the One Ring for himself.\n\nIn the Third Age, Sauron the Enemy returned to Middle-earth and, as the '''Necromancer''', took the hill of [[Amon Lanc]] as his fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]; one of his foremost servants, the [[Witch-king]], formed the realm of [[Angmar]] in the north of [[Eriador]]. Following an attack by the [[White Council]] in {{TA|2941}}, the Dark Lord Sauron returned to his fortress of [[Barad-dûr]] in [[Mordor]], marshalling his armies and using his two-faced ally, the corrupted [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Saruman]]. By {{TA|3018}}, [[Frodo Baggins]] was in possession of the Ring, and he was led by [[Gandalf]] as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] in the [[Quest of the Ring]]. Whilst Sauron waged the [[War of the Ring]] against the [[Free peoples]] of Middle-earth, Frodo Baggins, [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Gollum]] reached Mount Doom on [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}}, and the Ring was destroyed. The breaking of the Ring caused Sauron's fall, and his stepping on Morgoth's path down into the [[Void]], resulting in the start of the [[Fourth Age]] and the [[Dominion of Men]]. \n\n==History==\n===Origin===\n[[File:Maureval - Mairon.jpg|thumb|left|''Mairon'' by [[:Category:Images by Maureval|Maureval]]]]\n{{quote|For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so.|[[Elrond]]<ref name=\"lotr-coe\"/>}}\nAs one of the most powerful [[Maiar]], Sauron was [[Creation of the Ainur|created]] by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=\"Ainu\">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> At the beginning of [[Time]], he was amongst the [[Ainur]] who entered into [[Eä]].<ref name=\"SVala\">{{S|IId}}</ref> Here he became one of the Maiar of [[Aulë]], among whose people he was deemed mighty and surpassed only by the Smith himself,<ref name=\"SVala\" /> and was known as '''''Mairon'''''.<ref name=\"PE17.1\">{{PE|17}}, p. 183</ref><ref group=\"note\">Although it could be possible the name 'Mairon' was adapted by the Elves to [[Quenya]] originally from [[Valarin]] name with the same meaning much later, this pure Valarin form vanished in history.</ref>\n\nMairon's virtue was his love for order, planning and coordination, disliking confusion and chaos. But his obsession with order gradually overshadowed his love for the other intelligent beings of Arda, who would benefit from his planning; it became the sole object of his will, the end in itself. He started admiring [[Morgoth|Melkor]]'s power to realize his designs quickly and masterfully.<ref name=\"myths\" /> \n\nEarly on, already by the blissful [[Spring of Arda]], he was ensnared by Melkor, becoming his spy on the isle of [[Almaren]], the dwelling-place of the Valar.<ref name=\"Annals\">{{MR|P2a}}, p. 52</ref> While [[Tulkas]] was asleep, Melkor ruined the [[Two Lamps]], and when Almaren was also destroyed, the [[Valar]] moved to the [[Aman|Blessed Realm of Aman]], still not perceiving Sauron's treachery.<ref name=\"Valinor\">{{L|131}}: \"''… Sauron was a being of Valinor perverted to the service of the Enemy …''\"</ref> Soon Mairon left the Blessed Realm for [[Middle-earth]], [[Sleep of Yavanna|in a dark time]] where Melkor dominated limitlessly, and bent the knee before him as his greatest and most trusted servant.<ref name=\"SRings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref> Thus he came to be known as '''''Gorthaur''''' by the [[Sindar]] of [[Beleriand]] and '''''Sauron''''' by others. Sauron initially was not as evil as Morgoth, as he was serving someone and not himself;<ref name=\"SVala\" /> and unlike Melkor, who wanted to unmake and corrupt the world, Sauron wished to rule it and do what he wanted with it.<ref name=\"myths\">{{MR|Myths}}, pp. 394-398</ref>\n\nAfter [[Morgoth]] made his great fortress of [[Angband]] in the north-west of [[Middle-earth]], he appointed Sauron to be its commander.<ref name=\"SCaptivity\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>\n\n===First Age===\n{{quote|Sauron was become now a sorcerer of dreadful power, master of shadows and of phantoms, foul in wisdom, cruel in strength, misshaping what he touched, twisting what he ruled, lord of werewolves; his dominion was torment.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin]]\"}}\nAt some point after the [[Awakening of the Elves]], it was Sauron who first discovered them and their dwellings.<ref>{{NM|P1xiv}}, p. 107</ref> Following their subsequent discovery by [[Oromë]], the Valar [[Battle of the Powers|made war against Melkor]] to protect them and though they stormed Angband and Utumno, they failed to find Sauron.<ref name=\"SCaptivity\" /> Thus Sauron continued his evil operations; during the [[Great Journey|Great March]] of the [[Eldar]] to Valinor, it is said that he may have been responsible for the affliction upon the [[Atyamar|land of the Elves]] in the [[Vales of Anduin]], forcing the [[Elves]] to resume their journey.<ref>{{NM|P1vii}}, pp. 50-51</ref>\n\nWith the unchaining of Morgoth and his subsequent destruction of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], the [[Sun]] first rose and ushered in the awakening of [[Men]]. Leaving Sauron in command of the war, Morgoth left Angband in secret to find the second-born kindred of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] and to corrupt them to his will.<ref name=\"SWest\">{{S|West}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Fall of Fingolfin]], Sauron launched an attack on [[Tol Sirion]]. Utter fear descended upon [[Orodreth]] and those who defended the isle. Sauron assailed [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] and turned it into a watch tower for Morgoth. Therein Sauron sat and Tol Sirion the fair became [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], the Isle of Werewolves.<ref name=\"SFingolfin\">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nUpon hearing of the deeds of [[Barahir]] and his companions, Morgoth ordered Sauron to find and kill them. [[Gorlim]], one of Barahir's companions, was captured and brought before Sauron. Sauron promised that he would free Gorlim and his wife [[Eilinel]] in return for information. Under the terror of Sauron's eyes, Gorlim revealed everything he knew, and thus the hiding place of Barahir was betrayed to the enemy. Subsequently, Sauron revealed Eilinel was dead and had Gorlim put to death.<ref name=\"Beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n[[Beren]], son of [[Barahir]], promised to avenge his father's death. He wandered throughout [[Dorthonion]] as an outlaw and achieved great deeds that were heard far and wide. Morgoth set a high price on his head and Sauron, commanding a great army of [[werewolves]] and [[fell beasts]], sought for Beren.<ref name=\"Beren\" />\n\nLater, [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]], Beren, and their ten companions left [[Nargothrond]] in search of the [[Silmarils]]. Despite their being disguised as Orcs, Sauron espied them as they entered into the vale between [[Ered Wethrin]] and [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]] and was suspicious, as Orcs passing were supposed to report to him. He had them captured and they were brought to him. There Finrod and Sauron fought in songs of power; the strength of both was great, but Sauron was more powerful. He then stripped them of their Orc disguises but failed to discern who they were. He had them thrown into a dark pit where one by one they were devoured by a werewolf. Withstanding this horror, they refused to betray one another.<ref name=\"Beren\" />\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Huan Subdues Sauron.jpg|thumb|right|''Huan subdues Sauron'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nWhen all of their companions were dead, Finrod and Beren were the last who remained alive in Sauron's pit. When a werewolf went to attack Beren, Finrod Felagund used all his power to defeat it. In this he was successful. However, he was critically wounded and soon passed away. In that dark moment, [[Lúthien]] came to the bridge of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] and sang. From his tower of Minas Tirith, Sauron saw Lúthien and knew that it was the famous daughter of [[Melian]] and [[Thingol]]. He desired to capture her and hand her over to Morgoth. Therefore, he sent a wolf to the bridge, but it was quickly and silently slain by [[Huan]]. He sent many more, and each one Huan killed. Finally, he sent [[Draugluin]], sire of the werewolves of Angband. The fight between Huan and Draugluin was fierce. Eventually Draugluin fled and, before dying, he told his master that Huan was there. According to prophecy, Huan would not die until he had encountered the greatest of all wolves, so Sauron contrived to take on that role and defeat the hound. Therefore Sauron took on the form of a werewolf, the greatest the world had ever seen then, and went towards the bridge. So great was the terror of his approach that even Huan momentarily recoiled. Sauron leaped to attack Lúthien, but she drew her magic veil over his eyes, afflicting him with fatigue and blindness. Then Huan sprang upon Sauron and there they fought. The force of Sauron's malice alone left Lúthien weak and nearly unconscious, and the fighting was brutal and prolonged; however, he could not subdue the hound of [[Valinor]]. He was trapped within Huan's jaws and could not break free, even when he took the form of a serpent and finally his own shape. Rather than leave his physical form, he yielded to Lúthien, giving her control of the isle in return for his release. He then took the form of a vampire and fled to [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]], filling the forest with horror.<ref name=\"Beren\" />\n\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]], with the downfall of [[Morgoth]] and the destruction of [[Thangorodrim]], Sauron adopted a fair form and repented his evil deeds in fear of the wrath of the Valar. [[Eönwë]] ordered Sauron to return to [[Valinor]] in order to receive the judgement of Manwë. Sauron was not willing to suffer such humiliation, and he instead fled and hid himself in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"SRings\" />\n\n===Second Age===\n[[File:Mysilvergreen - Sauron-Annatar and the creation of the One Ring.png|thumb|right|''Sauron-Annatar and the creation of the One Ring'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]\nIt was {{SA|500|n}} years into the [[Second Age]] when Sauron started to stir again.<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> Sauron decided that the [[Valar]] had forgotten about [[Middle-earth]] and he once again turned to evil; many Men in [[East]] and [[South]], already corrupted by Melkor, fell under the [[Shadow]] by following him.<ref name=\"SRings\" /> By {{SA|882}}, [[Gil-galad]] sensed a shadow arising in the East and sent a [[Gil-galad's letter|warning]] to [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref> Around {{SA|1000}} Sauron was alarmed by the growing power of the [[Númenóreans]], and chose [[Mordor]] as a land to make into a stronghold. He began the building of [[Barad-dûr]], the Dark Tower, near Mount Doom.<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" />\n\nAlthough Sauron long knew that [[Men]] were easier to sway, he sought to bring the [[Elves]] into his service, as they were far more powerful.<ref name=\"SRings\" /> After lying hidden and increasing his power in secret, in {{SA|1200}} Sauron put on a fair visage, calling himself '''Annatar''', the Lord of Gifts, an emissary from the Valar.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', \"[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]\", \"Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn\"</ref> He was never welcome in [[Lindon]] as [[Elrond]] and [[Gil-galad]] did not trust him and refused to treat with him, although they did not perceive who he truly was.<ref name=\"SRings\" /> \n\nElsewhere Annatar was gladly received, especially in [[Eregion]], where only [[Galadriel]] distrusted him. The [[Noldorin]] smiths there learned much from him in art and magic, as their thirst for knowledge was great.<ref name=\"lotr-coe\">{{FR|Council}}</ref><ref name=\"lotr-toy\">{{App|SA}}</ref> Under the tutelage of Annatar and the leadership of [[Celebrimbor]], grandson of [[Fëanor]], the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], became more skilled than anyone save Fëanor himself. In the year {{SA|1500}}, when they reached the very height of their power, the Elves began the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], which according to Annatar, would help them preserve their powers over Middle-earth.\n\nBut Sauron was ready to begin his own plans, and in {{SA|1600}} - ten years after the completion of the Rings of Power - he created [[The One Ring]] to control the bearers of the other Rings. He invested most of his own power into the Ring as he forged it, so that it would be more powerful than the others. With its power he completed the building of the Dark Tower.<ref name=\"SRings\" /><ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> \n\nBut the Elves were not so easily ensnared, and as soon as Sauron put on the One Ring they and Celebrimbor were aware of him, and realised they were betrayed.<ref name=\"lotr-coe\" /><ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> They hid their Rings from Sauron and did not use them. Sauron demanded that the other Rings be given to him, for they would not have been made without his knowledge. The Elves refused, and the War was inevitable.<ref name=\"SRings\" />\n\n====[[Black Years]]====\nDuring this time, Sauron constructed the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor to prevent invasion, and raised massive armies of [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]], and Men, chiefly [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]] whom he dominated as a king and god. He had them make many fortified towns, and armed those under him with iron.<ref name=\"SRings\" /><ref name=\"dm\" /> \n\nThe [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] began in {{SA|1693}} and was a bloody conflict which destroyed Eregion and devastated much of Eriador.<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> Celebrimbor was slain and his body tied to a pole paraded at the head of Sauron's legions.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> The Elves were pushed back almost to the Blue Mountains, while their Dwarven allies (who had also rejected Sauron) retreated behind the walls of [[Moria]] where Sauron could not assail them.\n\nSauron was the [[Dark Lord]] of almost all of Middle-earth beyond the coasts, but the [[Númenóreans]] responded to the Elves' call for aid and sent a relief force. With united forces, Sauron's army was driven back and defeated near the [[Sarn Ford]] and withdrew to [[Tharbad]] where he was reinforced. But the Númenórean admiral [[Ciryatur]] had sent a fleet up the river Gwathló and Sauron's army was [[Battle of the Gwathló|attacked in the rear and utterly defeated]]. The Dark Lord fled back to Mordor with little more than his own bodyguard and a handful of Orcs.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, while Sauron's subsequent power never quite matched the height it had during the War with the Elves, many of his most powerful enemies' homelands had been devastated. As the Númenóreans established dominions around the [[Westlands]] (c. {{SA|1800}}),<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> Sauron's empire continued to expand to dominate barbarian Men as servants and worshippers to the far south and east.<ref name=\"dm\">{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> \n\nAs the Elves had failed him, he had decided to distribute the Rings of Power to three corrupted lords of [[Númenor]]<ref name=\"Akallabeth\">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> and [[Khamûl|an Easterling king]] and other five Men, as well as lords of the Dwarves. The Dwarves proved too hardy and resistant to their effects; but the Men eventually faded and in {{SA|2251}} they appeared as [[Ringwraiths]], his greatest slaves.<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" />\n\nBelieving he would dominate all of Middle-earth, Sauron assumed many glorious titles: '''King of Kings''',<ref name=\"L131\">{{L|131}}</ref> '''King of Men''',<ref name=\"Akallabeth\" /> '''Lord of the Earth''',<ref name=\"SRings\" /> and even '''Lord of the World'''.<ref name=\"L131\" />\n\n====On Númenor====\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - The Temple of Melkor.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''The Temple of Melkor'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nThis offended the arrogant [[Númenóreans]] who had already started to fall under the [[Shadow]]. The proud Númenóreans came to Middle-earth with great force of arms, and Sauron's forces fled. Realising he could not defeat the Númenóreans with military strength, Sauron allowed himself to be taken as a hostage to Númenor by King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] in {{SA|3262}}.<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> \n\nThere, he quickly grew from captive to adviser and was known as '''Zigûr''', the Wizard;<ref name=\"Defeated\">{{HM|SD}}, ''passim''</ref> he seduced the King and further corrupted the people.<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> He converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Darkness, becoming High Priest of a Melkor cult. He had the [[Nimloth (tree)|White Tree]] cut down and in its place raised a great [[Temple]] in which he performed human sacrifices, persecuting those who were still [[Faithful]]. Finally, he convinced the king to rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself, claiming they would gain immortality. [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], the supreme God, then directly intervened: Númenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of Númenor was destroyed.\n\nSauron was on Númenor in the Temple of Melkor and was caught in the ensuing [[Downfall of Númenor|flood]]. However, his spirit survived, although severely weakened by the destruction, and it fled back to Middle-earth.\n\n====Against the Faithful====\nSauron's spirit returned to Mordor in {{SA|3320}},<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> where he slowly rebuilt his strength, although he was unable to assume a fair shape. From this point on he started to rule through terror and force, largely filling the fearsome role left vacant by his former master.\n\nMeanwhile, a few faithful Númenóreans, led by [[Elendil]], were saved from the flood, and they founded [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] in Middle-earth. Sauron still considered them his hated enemies and he launched a pre-emptive attack on Gondor in {{SA|3429}}.<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> \n\nIn response, the Númenóreans formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] with the Elven-king [[Gil-galad]]. Learning of them, Sauron dispatched some [[Orcs of Mordor]] to the [[Misty Mountains]] to ambush them.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, Note #20</ref> He also burned the [[Brown Lands|gardens]] of the [[Entwives]] against the advance of the Allies down the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Allies reached Mordor and defeated Sauron's forces in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] in {{SA|3434}} and finally laid siege before [[Barad-dûr]].<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> \n\nThe siege lasted for seven years until {{SA|3441}}, when Sauron left his fortress, engaging in direct combat. Elendil and Gil-galad fought Sauron and vanquished him, but both were killed.<ref name=\"lotr-toy\" /> [[Isildur]], son of Elendil, cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claimed it. Later, the Ring betrayed him and was lost for more than two thousand years. After his defeat in the War of the Last Alliance, Sauron lost his ability to form a physical body for a great while.\n\n===Third Age===\nSauron's defeat released his subjects, like the [[Easterlings]], from his tyranny, but they fell into chaos. Their tribes and kingdoms battled against each other and some withdrew to the hated west.<ref>{{UT|6b}}, p. 259</ref> Weakened by his defeat and the loss of the One Ring, it is thought that he fled to the far east to regain his power and strength before returning. \n\nIt was not until c. {{TA|1000}} that Sauron could again begin to take shape in a physical living body. Worried by this prospect, the [[Valar]] sent [[Wizards|five]] [[Maiar]] from the West to assist the peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, pp. 388-389</ref>\n\nHis power was enough that he began again to throw a shadow across portions of [[Middle-earth]]. Apparently, Sauron's spirit managed to move some Easterlings, who invaded [[Rhovanion]] and came to the [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #60</ref> \n\n====The Necromancer====\nThese moves coincided with the coming of the [[Shadow]] to [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> Around {{TA|1050|n}} he chose [[Amon Lanc|a hill]] in southern Greenwood as a place to build the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]. At first, the [[Wise]] thought that this \"Necromancer\" was one of the [[Nazgûl]] who had returned and taken up residence in southern Greenwood.<ref name=\"TA\" />\n\nThe year {{TA|1300}} marked Sauron's increased power, evidenced by \"evil things\" who multiplied and grew bold again, like the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and some of the [[Dragons]], who attacked the [[Dwarves]]; and the return of the Nazgûl, with the founding of the evil realm of [[Angmar]].<ref name=\"TA\" /> In the following centuries, Sauron's subjects in Angmar, the East and the South concentrated against his ancient enemies. Kings [[Araphant]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]] realised that a single force was coordinating the attacks on both of their kingdoms and that they needed to work together to combat this evil. However, Angmar was successful in destroying Arnor, and soon after the Nazgûl gathered in Mordor and [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|conquered]] [[Minas Ithil]] to prepare for Sauron's return; their final success was ending the [[King of Gondor|royal line]] of Gondor.<ref name=\"SRings\" /><ref name=\"TA\" /><ref name=\"gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> As his shadow deepened, [[Durin's Bane|a balrog]] awoke, causing the desertion of [[Moria]].<ref name=\"TA\" /> \n[[File:John Howe - Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nBy {{TA|2060}} the power of Dol Guldur grew so much that [[the Wise]] were alerted that Sauron was returning. [[Gandalf]] entered the fortress in {{TA|2063|n}} but the shadow fled before him. Returning to the [[East]],<ref name=\"TA\" /> Sauron started corrupting the [[Easterlings]] and forging a strong alliance between their tribes.{{fact}} The period of his absence was known as the ''[[Watchful Peace]]'', because the Shadow on Mirkwood had lessened and the Nazgûl stayed quiet in Minas Morgul,<ref name=\"TA\" /> using this period to prepare for Sauron's return.\n\n====Return to Dol Guldur====\nThe Necromancer returned in {{TA|2460|n}} more powerful, with many Men in his service, and again took up residence in [[Dol Guldur]].<ref name=\"TA\" /> His return coincided with the One Ring revealing itself [[Third Age 2463|three years later]], falling in the hands of [[Gollum|a Stoor]]. Sensing the danger, the [[Wise]] formed the [[White Council]].<ref name=\"TA\" /> \n\nThe Necromancer's aims remained to gather the Rings of Power, find news about the One Ring, and eliminate the [[Heir of Isildur]], if one remained in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"TA\" /><ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> In {{TA|2475}} the [[Uruk-hai]] exited Mordor and briefly conquered [[Ithilien]]. [[Third Age 2480|Some years later]] the Orcs of the Mountains organised themselves, blocking the passes to the West; Moria had been depopulated centuries earlier by the Balrog, and Sauron sent Orcs and [[Trolls]] there.<ref name=\"TA\" /> Also under his shadow were the [[Balchoth]], who invaded Mirkwood and cooperated with Orcs to attack Gondor.<ref name=\"stew\" /> Sauron's servants captured the [[King of Durin's Folk|Dwarf King]] [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and took [[Ring of Thrór|one]] of the [[Seven Rings|Seven Dwarf rings]] from him.<ref name=\"TA\" /> \n\nStill investigating the Necromancer, [[Gandalf]] snuck into Dol Guldur in {{TA|2850|n}} and met the dying Dwarf King, learning that the Necromancer was none other than Sauron. [[Third Age 2851|The next year]], Gandalf informed the White Council and urged an immediate attack upon the fortress, but [[Saruman|Saruman the White]] had learned of the presence of the [[The One Ring|Ruling Ring]] near the [[Gladden Fields]], and he thought it best to allow Sauron to build up his strength in order to reveal its location so that Saruman could seize it himself. Following this strategy, Saruman opposed Gandalf.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nAs his power was growing and his arising came closer, his minions moved again against Gondor; his agents stirred the [[Haradrim]] to resume attacking Gondor, while [[Uruk-hai]] and [[Orcs of Mordor]] infested [[Ithilien]]<ref name=\"TA\" /><ref name=\"stew\" /> but never managed to pass beyond Anduin, further into Gondor.<ref name=\"hunt\">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref> All this time Sauron apparently had learned about the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] where his old enemy Isildur was killed, shortly after his own demise, almost three millennia ago. He sent his minions to look for the One Ring around [[Anduin]] near the [[Gladden Fields]], not knowing that it had been already in the possession of [[Gollum|a Stoor]].<ref name=\"TA\" />\n\n====Attack of the White Council====\nConsidering the situations, and the occupation of the dragon [[Smaug]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], Gandalf was worried that Sauron's military assault against the [[West]] was a matter of time, and that he would use Smaug in his force; Gandalf started considering a simultaneous attack both against Dol Guldur and against Smaug, to weaken Sauron.<ref name=\"erebor\">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>\n[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|''Dol Guldur'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]\nIn {{TA|2939}}, Saruman learned that Sauron was searching for the Ring, and worried that he would find it sooner than he. In {{TA|2941|n}}, he conceded with Gandalf to [[Attack on Dol Guldur|attack Dol Guldur]].<ref name=\"TA\" /> Indeed, in the meantime Gandalf managed to eliminate Smaug, and the Orcs of the Mountains were decimated in the [[Battle of Five Armies|ensuing battle]], allowing the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and [[Dale]] to flourish again.<ref name=\"erebor\" /><ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Gandalf was weakening Sauron's potential grasp in the [[Wilderland|North]],<ref name=\"erebor\" /> Sauron had been expecting the White Council's attack against Dol Guldur and fled from there.<ref name=\"TA\" />\n\n====Return to Mordor====\nThe [[Nazgûl]] had been preparing [[Barad-dûr]] for Sauron's return, so it was easy for Sauron to return secretly to his old stronghold [[Third Age 2942|a year later]]. Sauron declared himself openly in {{TA|2951}}, sent three Nazgûl back to Dol Guldur and started rebuilding the Dark Tower, and once it was completed, the [[Mount Doom]] erupted.<ref name=\"TA\" /><ref name=\"stew\">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n\nFrom then on, Sauron stayed in Barad-dûr to conduct his war on the [[Free peoples]]. The shadow of Mordor caused despair and sickness to the Gondorians, like [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]], and in his desperation, the Steward [[Denethor]], Sauron's most immediate enemy, used the [[Anor-stone]] to gain knowledge. That ''[[palantír]]'' was directly linked to the [[Ithil-stone]] that the Nazgûl had taken from Minas Morgul, and when Sauron used it, he discovered Denethor was using his. Sauron attempted to wrench the Anor-stone to his will, but failed due to Denethor's strength of will and birth-right to the stone. But this stressed and wore out the steward, who lost his hope.<ref name=\"stew\" /><ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>\n\nBy {{TA|3000}}, the shadow lengthened, and Saruman, who was residing in [[Orthanc]], had secretly found and decided to use the [[Orthanc-stone]]. As happened with Denethor, Sauron linked with his mind, managing to corrupt him;<ref name=\"TA\" /> from one of his wisest enemies, Saruman became one of his greatest allies.\n\nAround {{TA|3009}}, [[Gollum]], who formerly bore the One Ring and now pursued its thief, ventured into Mordor and was captured by Sauron's minions. Gollum was tortured and interrogated for the following years,<ref name=\"TA\" /> and before releasing him, Sauron learned that the One Ring had been found by [[Bilbo Baggins]] of [[the Shire]].\n\nSauron bred immense armies of Orcs and allied with or enslaved Men from the east and south. He adopted the symbol of a lidless eye, and he was able at that time to send out his will over Middle-earth, so that the [[Eye of Sauron]] became a symbol of power and fear.\n\n====The War of the Ring====\nSauron was alarmed when the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] captured Gollum,<ref name=\"TA\" /> so in June of {{TA|3018}} he dispatched the Nazgûl to hunt for [[the One Ring]] in secrecy. To disguise the crossing of the Nine over the Great River, Sauron staged an [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|attack on Osgiliath]]. This feint served two purposes: first, to test the strength and preparedness of Denethor, and second and more importantly, to present the Nazgûl as merely a military asset, concealing from the [[Wise]] their true mission.<ref name=\"hunt\" /> Denethor's forces were stronger than Sauron hoped, but Sauron took the eastern half of the city nonetheless. This allowed the Nazgûl to cross the Great River and begin their hunt.<ref name=\"hunt\" /> Now knowing the measure of his enemy, Sauron continued to amass his forces in Minas Morgul and Mordor in preparation for the siege of Gondor.<ref name=\"TT|IV4\">{{TT|IV4}}</ref>\n\nBy September, the Nazgûl had failed to discover the Shire, and Sauron's wrath and fear were mounting. Via messenger, Sauron ordered the Nine to discard secrecy in favour of speed and go to Isengard to confront Saruman about his knowledge of the whereabouts of the Ring. At this time, Sauron also conveyed to the Nine such dire threats as to dismay even the Lord of Morgul.<ref name=\"hunt\" /> The Nine ultimately failed in their mission, being defeated and unhorsed by the flood of the Bruinen. The Witch-king returned alone to Mordor in December of 3018 to Sauron's great fear, for Sauron perceived that his foes still had strength left in them, and luck seemed to be on their side.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"The Ring Goes South\", p. 262</ref>\n\nSauron's next glimpse of the Ring (or so he believed) would come in the late hours of [[5 March]] T.A. 3019, when Pippin looked into the ''palantír'' of Orthanc that he had recovered from the flood of Isengard. Sauron, unaware of Saruman's defeat at hands of the [[Ents]], assumed Pippin was the Wizard's prisoner, and was being forced to look into the ''palantír'' as a form of cruel sport. Rather than interrogate Pippin immediately, Sauron chose to torment him, and bid him tell Saruman that he would send for the prisoner immediately.<ref>{{TT|Palantir}}</ref> He was therefore deceived into thinking the Ring was finally within his grasp.\n\nA few hours later, on the morning of [[6 March]], Sauron encountered one of his foes in the ''palantír'' of Orthanc: Aragorn looked into the Stone, revealing himself to Sauron as the Heir of Isildur and wielder of [[Andúril]], the Blade Reforged. Aragorn spoke no word to Sauron and with a great effort of will wrested control of the Stone from him. As Aragorn intended, this played on Sauron's gnawing doubts and filled him with fear, believing that Aragorn might have overthrown Saruman, seizing Pippin and therefore the Ring. Thus, he ordered the Witch-king to launch his long-planned assault on Gondor immediately, rather than wait for all preparations to be made, hoping to destroy his enemies before they had a chance to make full use of the Ring's power.<ref name=\"RKV2\">{{RK|V2}}</ref>\n\nThe death of the Witch-king and the defeat of his army in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] were a setback to Sauron, but he still had a great force of arms held in reserve in Mordor, more than enough to eventually secure military victory against all of his enemies combined. After his encounter with Aragorn in the ''palantír'', Sauron believed that one of his foes in Minas Tirith held the One Ring and would soon attempt to use it. As such, Gandalf was able to exploit Sauron's false beliefs with an audacious plan: the army of the Free Peoples would march on the Black Gate as a feint, keeping Sauron's Eye fixed upon them and blind to all else that moved, as the true Ringbearer made his way to Mount Doom.<ref name=\"RKV9\">{{RK|V9}}</ref>\n\nFor the next nine days, Gandalf's plan worked - as the Host of the West made its way east and north, Sauron kept his entire focus upon it and diverted the whole strength of Mordor to the Black Gate to meet them. Even when Shagrat brought news of an \"Elvish\" intruder in [[Cirith Ungol]], Sauron's belief that the Ring was with the Host of the West remained unshaken and he made no attempt to investigate further; he could certainly not imagine that his enemies were trying to sneak the Ring into Mordor. Frodo and Sam thus made it to the [[Cracks of Doom|Sammath Naur]] undetected, and Sauron did not become aware of them until the very moment that Frodo claimed the Ring for himself.<ref name=\"RKVI3\">{{RK|VI3}}</ref> [[File:Ted Nasmith - The Shadow of Sauron.jpg|thumb|''The Shadow of Sauron'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\nOnly then did Sauron finally perceive Frodo and, realising he had been tricked, was overwhelmed with wrath and fear. He instantly lost all interest in the ongoing [[Battle of the Morannon]] and dispatched the Nazgûl from the skies above the battle to Mount Doom with all haste. It was too late; Gollum fell into the Crack of Doom with the Ring, destroying it and himself. In the moment of the Ring's destruction, Barad-dûr and many other of Sauron's fortresses crumbled to ruin. Sauron's spirit emerged and rose above Mordor like a black cloud - he stretched out his hand towards the army of the West, but even as he did so, he was blown away by a great wind and vanished.<ref name=\"RKVI4\">{{RK|VI4}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThus Sauron's power was unmade, and his dominion in Middle-earth came to an end. According to Gandalf, Sauron was \"maimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape.\"<ref name=\"RKV9\" /> Sauron's corporeal body that was in the Dark Tower died, and without the Ring, his spirit no longer had the power to create a new one. Though his indestructible mind and being were bound forever to [[Eä]], Sauron had lost all power to effect his will upon the world<ref>{{L|200}}</ref> and could never again grow in strength.<ref>{{MR|P5VII}}, section iii, p. 403 and note 11, p. 407</ref>\n\nIt is said of Sauron, in summary of his long career of wickedness in Arda, that \"he rose like a shadow of Morgoth and a ghost of his malice, and walked behind him on the same ruinous path down into the Void.\"<ref name=\"SVala\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\nSauron was a being of exceptional power, both in personal might and in sorcery, yet his greatest strength lie in his cunning, intellect, and charisma; through persuasion, deception, and coercion, he brought ruin to many mortal realms and united others unto himself, often without ever having to physically intervene, and he nearly cast Middle-earth into darkness several times throughout his existence. \n\nMuch like his [[Morgoth|master]], pride in his own abilities was his greatest personal weakness, and this arrogance, coupled with an underestimation of his enemies, would ultimately doom him.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>\n\n===Physical form===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Sauron.jpg|thumb|right|Tolkien's unfinished sketch of Sauron, apparently showing him just after the destruction of the Ring]]\nAt first Sauron appeared as a royal and commanding figure in a strong body. He was also able to veil his power and change his shape. Later, however, he could take only a terrible form, of a stature greater than a [[Men|Man]]'s, though not giant,<ref>{{L|246}}</ref> \"an image of malice and hatred made visible; and the Eye of Sauron the Terrible few could endure.\"<ref name=\"Akallabeth\" /> [[Isildur]] recounted that at the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], Sauron's hand was black with a deadly burning touch.<ref name=\"lotr-coe\" /> Gollum would also call him \"Black Hand\", noticing he only had four fingers after Isildur cut one off.<ref name=\"Closed\">{{TT|IV3}}</ref>\n\n===Eye of Sauron===\nThe '''[[Eye of Sauron]]''', called by various names, was the symbol of Sauron the Dark Lord following the loss of [[the One Ring]]. This symbol was adopted to show his unceasing vigilance and piercing perception, and was displayed on the weaponry of his servants, or at least the [[orcs]].\n\nSauron's Eye as Frodo sees it in the [[Mirror of Galadriel]] is the only feature of his later form described in detail. It is yellow and rimmed with fire, with a slit pupil, \"a window into nothing.\"<ref>{{FR|II7}}</ref> The colour is compared to that of a cat's eye, but because of the references to Sauron's Lidless Eye, it may also resemble that of a snake, such as an adder. Readers differ as to whether Sauron's eyes were literally lidless and resembled what Frodo saw, or instead the Eye was only a symbol that Frodo saw in the Mirror in an elaborate form. \n\nSauron's gaze, even indirectly, was known to wither, exhaust, and weaken his foes, with [[Denethor II|Denethor]], [[Aragorn II|Aragorn]], and [[Gandalf]] all rendered weary and dreadful after confronting him.<ref>{{FR|Breaking}}</ref> The sheer malevolence Sauron exuded through his presence alone was enough to render Lúthien frail and nearly unconscious.<ref name=\"Beren\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{pronounce|Quenya - Sauron.mp3|Gilgamesh}}\n'''''Sauron''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈsaʊron]}})<ref group=\"note\">''Sauron'' is pronounced \"sour-on\" (''sour'' as in not sweet).</ref> is a [[Quenya]] name, said to mean \"the Abhorred\".<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Sauron\"</ref>\n\nSeveral accounts of the origin of the name ''Sauron'' were suggested in different linguistic manuscripts:\n*deriving from Quenya ''[[saura]]'' (\"foul, evil-smelling, putrid\", from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[THUS#Other versions|THUS]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[THUS]]-\"</ref>\n*deriving from Quenya ''[[saura]]'' (\"foul, vile\"; from root [[SAWA]]).

He continued to call himself Mairon the Admirable, or '''Tar-mairon''' (\"King Excellent\"), until after Númenor's downfall,<ref name=\"PE17.1\" /> although he could not use that name in Númenor, as it was a Quenya name with royal implications.

The prototype of this character was '''[[Tevildo]]''', lord of the cats, who played the role later taken by Sauron in the earliest version of the story of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]'', \"[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]\". Morgoth also had another servant named '''[[Fankil]]''' who led evil [[Dwarves]] and notably acted as his lieutenant, a role assumed by Sauron in the final works. \n\nTevildo later was transformed into '''[[Thû]]''', the Necromancer - the first proper iteration of the later Sauron. The name was then changed to ''Gorthû'', ''Sûr'', and finally to Sauron. ''Gorthû'', in the form ''Gorthaur'', remained in ''The Silmarillion''.\n\nIn the first version of the Fall of Númenor, Sûr (Thû) originally came to Númenor in the likeness of a great bird and preached a message of deliverance, and he prophesied the second coming of Morgoth. He spoke with the king (Angor) and queen (Istar) and promised them undying life and lordship of the Earth. They believed him and fell under the shadow, and the greatest part of the people of Númenor followed them. Angor raised a great temple to Morgoth in the midst of the land, and Sûr dwelt there.<ref name=\"downfall1\">{{LR|P1II2}}</ref>{{rp|§5}} As Angor felt the oncoming of old age, Sûr convinced the king that that the gifts of Morgoth were withheld by the Gods, and that to obtain plenitude of power and undying life he must be master of the West. Sûr then aided the Númenóreans in making their great armament.<ref name=\"downfall1\" />{{rp|§6}} Thû survived the destruction of the island and retreated to Middle-earth where he fought wars against the surviving Númenóreans, whose hearts were not crooked and hated Thû, that assailed his temples and servants.<ref name=\"downfall1\" />{{rp|§13}} Eventually Amroth,<ref group=\"note\">This Amroth is a predecessor to Eldendil, hence is a Man, not an Elf</ref> the King of Beleriand, took council with Elrond, and with what Elves remained they crossed over the mountains and assailed the fortress of Thû; Amroth himself was slain, but Thû was brought to his knees, with his servants dispelled and his dwellings destroyed, and he fled to a dark forest and hid himself.<ref name=\"downfall1\" />{{rp|§14}}\n\nPrior to the publication of ''The Silmarillion'', Sauron's origins and true identity were unclear to those without full access to Tolkien's notes. For example, in early editions of ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth|The Guide to Middle Earth]]'', Sauron was described as \"probably of the Eldar elves\".\n\n===The Necromancer===\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the Necromancer is an obscure villainous entity mentioned fleetingly by [[Gandalf]] as one of the dangers of the wider world. He is peripheral to the plot of the book: explaining why the company takes the dangerous road through Mirkwood rather than going around, and providing a reason for Gandalf's absence for that section of the journey. Thematically the Necromancer, a truly 'terrible' force beyond the power of the main protagonists, gives the world of ''The Hobbit'' a greater level of reality which Tolkien felt was necessary for a \"fairy-tale\" to ring true.<ref name=\"Letter17\">{{L|17}}</ref>\n\nDespite the alias, it would appear that the Necromancer was always intended to stand for Sauron, a figure from the very earliest phases of his legendarium (as [[Tevildo]] in \"[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]\"). Shortly after the publication of ''The Hobbit'' Tolkien wrote:\n\n{{blockquote|Mr Baggins began as a comic tale among conventional and inconsistent Grimm's fairy-tale dwarves, and got drawn into the edge of it &ndash; so that even Sauron the terrible peeped over the edge.|[[Letter 19]]}}\n\nIndeed, in the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'', [[Thû]] is called a \"necromancer\" who \"held his hosts of [[phantoms]] and of wandering [[ghosts]]\" (l. 2075) in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]].<ref>{{LB|C7}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as ''The Hobbit'' was not originally intended to be integrated with Tolkien's wider mythology the Necromancer did not necessarily need to be consistent with his [[First Age]] counterpart Sauron, rather the two were loosely linked to add an 'impression of depth' to the narrative of ''The Hobbit''. With Tolkien's decision to merge the two 'worlds' and make Sauron the central antagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' came the need to reconcile the two figures and account for his whereabouts in the millennia between the end of the First Age and his dwelling in Bilbo's Mirkwood. This was largely achieved in the ''[[Appendix B|Tale of Years]]'', with Sauron becoming a much greater figure after the fall of his master, one who arguably drove the history of the entire Second and Third Ages of Middle-earth.\n\nFans have noted that the alias \"Necromancer\" for Sauron is obscure, as in the context of neither ''The Hobbit'' nor ''The Lord of the Rings'' Sauron is ever specifically mentioned to use [[Wikipedia:necromancy|necromancy]], i.e. controlling the [[spirits]] of the dead.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/47756/why-is-sauron-called-the-necromancer|articlename=Why is Sauron called the \"Necromancer\"?|dated=|website=Stackexchange|accessed=9 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nA later essay mentions the practice of necromancy concerning the ''[[fëar]]'' of the [[Unbodied]] Elves, mentioning that Sauron possibly did so and also taught his followers,<ref>{{MR|P3II3c}}, p. 224</ref> although this reference is not given in the context of the story.\n\n==Minions and allies==\n*[[Thuringwethil]]- Vampire Herald\n*[[Draugluin]]- First of the Werewolves of Angband; mortally-wounded by [[Huan]]\n*The [Witch-king|[Witch-king of Angmar]] - Lord of Morgul, Lord of the Nazgûl and deadliest servant; vanquished by [[Éowyn]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]\n**[[Khamûl]] - Lieutenant of Dol Guldur, second only to the Witch-king among the Nazgûl; undone by the destruction of [[the One Ring]]\n**Other 7 [[Nazgûl]] - Most terrible of his servants; perished with the One Ring\n*The [[King of the Dead]] - King of the Oathbreakers, former servant bound to the [[Heir of Isildur]]\n*[[Ar-Pharazôn]] - Last King of Númenor, rival-turned-puppet, coerced to the worship of the Darkness\n*[[Herumor]] - Lord among the Haradrim\n*[[Fuinur]] - Chief among the Haradrim\n*[[Captain of the Haven]] - Commander of the Corsairs of Umbar; slain by [[Aragorn]]\n*The [[Mouth of Sauron]] - Lieutenant of the Dark Tower and personal Ambassador\n**[[Grishnákh]] - Orc captain of the Dark Tower; slain by the Riders of Rohan\n*[[Saruman]] - Lord of Isengard, corrupted White [[Wizards|Wizard]] and treacherous ally; stabbed in the back by Gríma\n**[[Gríma]] - Chief counsellor of King [[Théoden]] in Rohan, Saruman's mole at the court; shot by Hobbit arrows\n**[[Squint-eyed southerner]] - Dunlending spy at the Prancing Pony Inn\n**[[Bill Ferny]] - Outlaw of Bree-land\n**[[Harry Goatleaf]] - Gate-keeper of the West-gate of Bree, informant\n*[[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] - Lieutenant of Morgul, second only to the Witch-king among the Morgul-host\n**[[Gorbag]] - Captain of the Orcs of Morgul that captured [[Frodo Baggins]]; murdered by Shagrat\n*[[Shagrat]] - Captain of Cirith Ungol; put to death for his failures \n**[[Muzgash]] - Orc guard at Cirith Ungol; shot by treacherous comrades\n**[[Lagduf]] - Orc sentry stationed at Cirith Ungol; shot by treacherous comrades\n**[[Radbug]] - Orc sentinel of Cirith Ungol; had his eyes squeezed out by Shagrat\n**[[Snaga (orc of Mordor)|Snaga]] - Torturer of Cirith Ungol; fell to his demise in a fight with [[Samwise Gamgee]]\n**[[Ufthak]] - Orc subordinate in Cirith Ungol; caught by Shelob in her webs\n*[[Shelob]] - Descendant of [[Ungoliant]] and convenient guardian of the pass through Mordor\n*The [[Two Watchers]] - Statues inhabited by evil spirits\n;Characters from older concepts\n*[[Naglur-Danlo]] - Orc of Cirith Ungol\n*[[Shagram]] - Orc soldier of Cirith Ungol\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Sauron in Adaptations===\n<gallery class=center mode=nolines widths=225 heights=150>\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Prologue.jpg|Sauron in [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:LOTR-vol2-Sauron1.png|Sauron in ''[[J.R.R.

In these films, he is depicted as a tall -yet not gigantic - armored warlord wielding a huge mace (a blend between his vague description by Tolkien and the more detailed appearance of [[Morgoth]] as described in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''). In the first film, he is depicted dispatching a number of Elves and Men with his mace, before killing [[Gil-galad]] (offscreen; the scene figured in the concept art done for the prologue, however) and then [[Elendil]] before being defeated by [[Isildur]] using his father's [[Narsil|broken sword]] to cut off the finger wearing [[the One Ring]], as well as three others on the same hand. This strangely causes his body to explode, producing a shockwave that knocks everyone on the battlefield off their feet.\n\n:Later on, [[Saruman]] implies to [[Gandalf]] that Sauron was unable to retain his physical form and that the Eye was his astral form, a detail which is never brought up in the novel. It is unknown if Saruman was truthful with this statement, or if he was either misinformed or lying (since he was already corrupted by his yearning for power and Sauron's influence).\n\n:For the portrayal of Sauron as a giant eye of fire in these movies, see [[Eye of Sauron#Portrayal in adaptations]].\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Sauron is played and voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], under his assumed identity as the Necromancer. In these films, it is stated that the White Council does not discover he is Sauron until much later, during the events of these films, previously believing him to be a human with skills in magic. In these films, Sauron initially appears as a shadowy figure before assuming his armoured form from the previous films. With him as the slit black pupil, he projects flames around him, creating the visage of the Great Eye.\n\n'''2017: ''[[Wikipedia:The Lego Batman Movie|The Lego Batman Movie]]'':'''\n:In the film, Sauron, appearing as a flaming eye from atop his tower, is among the villains recruited by The Joker to aid in his conquest of Gotham City.

He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their making...|[[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[The Shadow of the Past]]\"}}\n\n'''Saruman the White''' was the first of the order of [[Wizards]] (or ''[[Istari]]'') who came to [[Middle-earth]] as Emissaries of the [[Valar]] in the [[Third Age]]. For a time he was the chief of the Wizards, as well as the head of the [[White Council]]. However, through his appreciation of [[Sauron]]'s innate strength, his envy of [[Gandalf]] and his overbearing hubris, the White Wizard fell into mimicry of the [[Dark Lord]] as his capable yet faithless servant, plotting to share in his power or to two-facedly seize the [[One Ring]] first. \n\nBoth at Sauron's whim and for his own ambitions, Saruman coordinated assaults from his [[Orthanc]] tower in [[Isengard]] against the realm of [[Rohan]] during the [[War of the Ring]], while sapping the kingdom through his agent Gríma. However, the corrupted Wizard's legions were vanquished and he was forced to remain a prisoner in his own tower, though not for long. Allowed to leave Orthanc, he travelled to the [[Shire]], which his outlaw pawns had gained control over, and became the hidden local thug lord. Saruman was again defeated by the rallied, oppressed Hobbits and he himself was backstabbed by Gríma for his mistreatment. His unbodied spirit was denied the [[West]] and fled naked and impotent, a fate not unlike that of Sauron.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nAs a [[Maia]], Saruman was created by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=\"Ainu\">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> In his early days in [[Valinor]], he went by the name ''[[Curumo]]''<ref name=\"Istari6\">{{UT|13a}}, note 6, p. 401</ref> or ''Tarindor''.<ref name=\"Cuv\" /> Like Sauron, he was a powerful Maia of [[Aulë]].<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Valar discovered the primeval [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]], Tarindor was one of the [[Five Guardians]] sent to protect the Elves from the forces of [[Melkor]].<ref name=\"Cuv\">{{NM|P1xiii}}, p. 95</ref> It is unclear how long he remained or if he accompanied the [[Eldar]] on the [[Great Journey]].\n\n===Return to Middle-earth===\nAfter the defeat of Morgoth, the Valar grew concerned about the rising power of Sauron in Middle-earth. In Valinor, a council was called by [[Manwë]], where it was decided to send Maiar as emissaries to Middle-earth to help the [[Free Peoples]] challenge Sauron. The council likely met in the middle of the Second Age, shortly after the creation of the [[Rings of Power]]. The council determined that these emissaries (who became known as the Istari or Wizards) should be \"mighty, peers of Sauron, yet [they should] forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh so as to treat on equality and win the trust of Elves and Men.\"<ref name=\"Istari\">{{UT|Istari}}</ref>{{rp|393}} Curumo, who was sent to the council by Aulë, volunteered to travel to Middle-earth as an emissary; he was appointed the first Istar and became the chief of their Order.<ref name=\"Istari\" />{{rp|389, 394}}\n\nEven before arriving in Middle-earth, Curumo begrudged his peers among the Istari. ''[[Gandalf|Olórin]]'' (later called Gandalf), who did not wish to travel to Middle-earth, was commanded by Manwë to go as the third Istar. Saruman's jealousy of Gandalf began here, when [[Varda]] said of Gandalf that he was \"not the third\". Saruman was charged to take [[Aiwendil]] (later called Radagast) with him to please [[Yavanna]], which he did not wish to do, and this led to his contempt for the latter Wizard.<ref name=\"Istari\" />{{rp|393}}\n\nIn Middle-earth, Curomo became known in [[Sindarin]] as ''[[Curunír]]'' and in [[Westron]] by his most common name, ''Saruman''. Like the other Wizards, his [[fana]] took the appearance of an old man. He had raven hair and was robed in white.<ref name=\"Istari\" />{{rp|393}}\n\nSaruman and others of the Istari arrived in Middle-earth on a ship at [[Mithlond]] (the [[Grey Havens]]) in [[Lindon]] around the year 1000 of the Third Age.<ref name=\"Istari\" /> At the time of their arrival, their origin, nature, purpose, and true names were a secret to nearly everyone in Middle-earth. Having witnessed their arrival, [[Círdan]] alone knew the truth of their identity and origin. He chose to give [[Narya]], the Red Ring, to Gandalf to aid him in his mission.<ref name=\"AppTA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> Círdan told only [[Galadriel]] and [[Elrond]] of the true origins of the Istari.<ref name=\"SV\" /> After a time, Saruman learned of Círdan's gift and begrudged it; this heightened the hidden ill-will that he bore towards Gandalf.<ref name=\"Istari\" />\n\nShortly after arriving, Saruman travelled into the [[East]] of Middle-earth, as did the two [[Blue Wizards]]. After one and a half millennia he returned to the West, just as Sauron's power was growing again in [[Dol Guldur]].\n\n===Chief of the White Council===\n[[File:Angus McBride - Saruman.gif|thumb|''Saruman'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]\nWhen the White Council was formed around {{TA|2463}},<ref name=\"AppTA\" /> Saruman was appointed its leader despite Galadriel's wishes that Gandalf be leader. Even then, he had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron and to envy and desire his power, and especially his One Ring. Coincidentally, in that same year, the One Ring was found by the creature [[Gollum]],<ref name=\"AppTA\" /> drawing the Dark Lord closer to the conflict that would eventually prove Saruman's undoing.\n\nDuring this period, Saruman spent years in [[Minas Tirith]] examining its archives. It is possible that there he surmised that a [[Palantíri|''palantír'']] would still be located in Orthanc, the tower of Isengard.<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> He offered to make Isengard his home and to command the defences of the West. This was welcomed by King [[Fréaláf]] of Rohan and [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] of [[Gondor]] alike. In {{TA|2759}}, Saruman was given the [[Key of Orthanc]] in the ring of Isengard his abode, hoping that he would prove an important ally.<ref name=\"SV\">{{S|V}}</ref><ref name=\"stew\">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> There he became important in the defence of the free lands of the West. In Orthanc he came upon the [[Orthanc-stone]], one of the seven seeing stones, but kept it secret and hidden, particularly from the White Council.<ref name=\"AppEorl\" /> He would later betray the Council by concealing his use of it. \n\nIn {{TA|2851}}, the White Council met and Gandalf revealed that the evil presence in Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron and that he had returned, and urged an attack there. Saruman however believed that Sauron would be useful in his quest: allowing Sauron to build up his strength, the One Ring would reveal itself, and Saruman hoped to have sufficient strength to seize it first himself until that event. With this strategy in mind, Saruman overruled Gandalf. It soon became clear that Saruman desired to possess the One Ring himself.<ref name=\"c250\">{{FR|Council}} p. 250-51</ref>\n\nHe soon found that Sauron had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected, and in {{TA|2941}} he finally consented to an [[Attack on Dol Guldur]] against Sauron at which point Sauron retreated to [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"AppTA\" /><ref name=\"c250\" />\n[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Dol Guldur'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]\nIn {{TA|2953}}, the [[Wise]] gathered once more to debate about the Rings of Power. Saruman quieted the Council claiming to have the knowledge that the One Ring was lost forever in the [[Belegaer]]. Following their final meeting (and the death of [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Turgon]]), Saruman took Isengard for his own and fortified it.<ref name=\"stew\" /> Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; thus he discovered the existence of the Shire and noted Gandalf's interest in it, and started sending agents in [[Bree]] and the [[Southfarthing]].<ref name=\"AppTA\" /> As [[Lord of Isengard]], Saruman began to bring trouble to Rohan by aiding its enemies.<ref name=\"AppEorl\">{{App|Eorl}}</ref> But the Wise were already suspicious about him; [[Aragorn]] tried to advise Steward [[Ecthelion II]] not to trust Saruman for his help against Sauron.<ref name=\"stew\" />\n\nSauron had declared himself openly in Mordor; he established contact with Saruman through the [[Ithil-stone]] his minions had captured from [[Minas Ithil]]. Through his jealousy towards Gandalf and his ever-growing pride and arrogance, and through the use of the ''palantír'', Saruman was ensnared by Sauron. Using either the knowledge of his new ally or lore of lost [[Eregion]], Saruman crafted his own lesser ring and sought to emulate Sauron. His corruption was complete around {{TA|3000}}.<ref name=\"AppTA\" /> The Wizard intended to share in the Dark Lord's power one way or another; he would aid in Sauron's victory to win his approval and become his equal lieutenant, or cheat him and try to supplant him by acquiring the One Ring for himself. \n\n===War of the Ring===\nAt about this time, in an attempt to control Rohan, Saruman bought the allegiance of King [[Théoden]]'s chief advisor, [[Gríma]], who then counselled the ailing king to do nothing about the steady resurgence of Sauron's armies. Saruman and Gríma's treachery would have crippled Rohan's military might and allowed Sauron lordship of the kingdom, had not Gandalf interfered a year later and revealed to Théoden his right-hand man's true designs, healing the old king and revitalising his political and military rule.<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>\n\nHe had sent spies to negotiate the purchase of [[pipe-weed]] from the Shire, in preparation for the war, and also learn of any [[Hobbits]] who had departed recently in hopes of finding out who possessed the One Ring.<ref name=\"UT10\">{{UT|10}}, \"Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire\"</ref> \n\nSaruman did not reveal his true intentions until Gandalf presented him with the discovery and location of the One Ring. On [[10 July]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf arrived at Isengard.<ref name=\"AppGreat\">{{App|Great}}</ref> Saruman demanded that Gandalf submit to him or to Sauron. Saruman then stood forth as [[Many Colours|Saruman of Many Colours]], and when Gandalf refused to join his new Lord or tell him of the Ring, he held him captive in Isengard. \n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Gríma and Saruman.jpg|thumb|left|Saruman commanding his forces from Orthanc as seen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' film]]\n\nIt must have been during Gandalf's captivity in Orthanc that Saruman began to assemble his following of [[Orcs]], [[Dunlendings]] and [[Uruk-hai]] into a massive army, since Gandalf came to an as yet undestroyed Isengard. From the pinnacle of the tower Gandalf could see that Saruman was gathering his hordes of Orcs and [[Wolves]] in his pits and forges, both in service and in competition with Sauron.<ref name=\"FRCouncil\">{{FR|Council}}</ref> One can speculate that if matters had developed a little more slowly, his puppet Gríma would have gained full control over Rohan, and the [[Rohirrim]] would have been enslaved or destroyed.\n\nGandalf later escaped, and so Saruman's treachery and professed allegiance to Sauron became known to the rest of the White Council when Gandalf reported this during the subsequent [[Council of Elrond]].<ref name=\"FRCouncil\" />\n\nSaruman soon also betrayed his master, Sauron, by lying to the [[Witch-king]] when he arrived at Isengard. Sauron had sent the [[Nazgûl]] searching for [[Bilbo Baggins|Baggins]], who had found the One Ring years before, and the Shire, his home. Saruman pretended to know nothing about the Shire. But the Lord of Minas Morgul and his company did not have the strength to assault the Ring of Isengard. Saruman told them that he believed Gandalf knew the whereabouts of the Ring, and the Nazgûl departed.<ref name=\"UTHunt\" />\n\nIn September of {{TA|3018}}, the Nazgûl captured one of his Shire [[Squint-eyed southerner|spies]] who told the [[Witch-king]] everything, betraying Saruman, and exposing the Wizard's double treachery. They also seized some maps and information about the Shire and [[Baggins]].<ref name=\"UT10\" /> Perceived as a turncoat by the Free Peoples and fearing being caught as an unfaithful vassal of Mordor, Saruman put all efforts into reassuring Sauron of his commitment or obtaining the One Ring for himself.<ref name=\"UTHunt\">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>\n\nThe failure to capture the Ring at [[Emyn Muil]] further ruined Saruman's plans, as he was revealed as a certain traitor to Sauron as well.\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Wrath of the Ents.jpg|thumb|''The Wrath of the Ents'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\nFinding himself in a precarious position, Saruman could only hope to acquire the Ring or convince Sauron of his loyalty. Therefore he implemented an aggressive strategy of attacking Rohan, endeavouring to kill the King's son [[Théodred]], sending spies to waylay [[Frodo Baggins]] on his flight from the Shire, and dispatching raiding parties on likely routes a company of the Ring might take to Gondor. Ironically, one of these parties captured [[Peregrin Took]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and transported them to [[Fangorn Forest]] in time to mobilise the [[Ents]]. Gandalf also suspected Saruman had found (and destroyed) the remains of [[Isildur]], who had worn the Ring before it had been lost.\n\nSaruman's Shire network failed to capture Frodo Baggins, Gandalf rallied Rohan to victory, [[Éomer]] stopped his brutal, but only partially successful raiding party, and control of Isengard was lost to the Ents. Aware he was utterly defeated, Saruman briefly considered repenting for his deeds, but at the last moment could not go through with it. Whether he had hope he could escape, whether he was too proud to surrender to Gandalf, or whether he thought his master would pardon him, Saruman refused to leave the confines of his fortress. Saruman made a final attempt to woo Théoden and Gandalf to his cause but failed: his staff was broken and he was expelled from the Order of the Istari.\n\nLeft out of the final stages of the War of the Ring and unable to be of any use to Sauron, he eventually managed to convince his captors, the Ents, to let him leave Isengard, as apparently the magic of his voice still remained. \n\n[[File:Matt Stewart - The Voice of Isengard.jpg|thumb|''The Voice of Isengard'' by [[:Category:Images by Matt Stewart|Matt Stewart]]]]\n[[File:Valera Lutfullina - Nasty End.jpg|thumb|200px|right|\"Nasty End\" by [[:Category:Art by Valera Lutfullina|Valera Lutfullina]]]]\n\nOn their way to northern [[Dunland]], on [[28 August]]<ref name=\"chief\">{{App|Chief}}</ref> they were confronted by Gandalf, [[Celeborn]], Galadriel and the Hobbits, but they passed as travelling beggars as Saruman kicked Gríma to move on, and he exclaimed how he hated his lord. Gandalf told Gríma that he was free to leave him but he did not reply. As Saruman was considered powerless, there was little concern for his escape.<ref name=\"Partings\">{{RK|Partings}}</ref> On [[22 September]]<ref name=\"chief\" /> they entered to the Shire, which his ally [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] (undisturbed by events elsewhere) had brought under control. He established himself in [[Hobbiton]] and spent his final days as a small-time thug lord whom his [[ruffians]] called Sharkey, imposing a terror regime to avenge himself upon the peaceful Halflings. But even this operation fell apart after Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] returned; he was eventually betrayed and killed by his own agent Gríma on [[3 November]], {{TA|3019}}.\n\nSaruman, who was a Maia, had lost his shape with his \"death\". As a discorporate spirit, he turned westward, but a wind came from the [[West]] and pushed him away. Apparently his spirit was left naked, powerless, and wandering in Middle-earth, not unlike Sauron after the One Ring was destroyed.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Gregor Roffalski - Curunír.jpg|thumb|''Curunír'' by [[:Category:Images by Gregor Roffalski|Gregor Roffalski]]]]\nIn appearance, Saruman was as an old man with black hair. At the end of the Third Age, his hair and beard had turned mostly white — he had only black hairs about his lips and ears. He was tall, his face was long, and his eyes were deep and dark.<ref name=\"Voice\"/> He would appear in a white cloak, a habit he later changed into a cloak that changed colours as he moved.\n\nHe was not actually a [[Men|Man]], or even an Elf (as Men often suspected), but a Maia clothed in flesh — an Istar (see ''Origins'' above). As such, he was immortal and extremely powerful, yet had limits on how far these powers could be used. His two most salient powers were his knowledge and his voice. Saruman was, in a very real way, the junior brother of Sauron both having been Maia of Aulë, Valar of Smithcraft, in the very beginnings of time. The parallels between Sauron and Saruman in both character and actions are many.\n\n===Powers===\nKnowledge of the \"deep arts\" (or magic, such as it is in Middle-earth) was of particular interest to Saruman, especially when relating to power such as the Rings of Power and the far-seeing ''palantíri''. He was also deeply learned in ancient lore regarding powerful kingdoms such as [[Númenor]], [[Gondor]], and [[Moria]]. \n\nHis voice and speech were extremely convincing, more powerful than mere rhetoric. When he focused this power on a person or a group of people, he could sway their hearts, plant fears and sow lies as he pleased. According to the stature of the listener, this spell could last as long as the speech did, or it could take root in them and last forever. Saruman's voice was so powerful that he was able to convince the Witch-king that he knew nothing of the One-Ring or the Shire.<ref>{{Cite DTP|UT 3.04.01.013}}</ref> His voice was not hypnotic, however, rather it was persuasive; and the real danger the voice posed to the listener was not them falling into a trance, but agreeing with it.<ref>{{Cite DTP|LR 3.10.045}}</ref>\n\nAside from his voice, Saruman has other subtle abilities such as giving great speed and motivation to his orcs at a distance and setting his will against all those in his dominion that might oppose him. Aragorn takes note of this ability while tracking the party of orcs holding Merry and Pippin hostage. Saruman also seems to be able to move around totally unheard by others, as there are numerous examples of him using this ability. Several examples include his sneaking up on Aragorn, [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]]'s camp in [[The Riders of Rohan]], his wholly unheard entrance in [[The Voice of Saruman]] and his quiet but sudden appearance to the hobbits in [[The Scouring of the Shire]]. \n\nOther powers include knowledge of machinery and chemistry, probably separable from explicit magic (for instance, the \"blasting fire\" employed by his Uruk-hai army in the battle of [[Helm's Deep]], was some kind of chemical explosive). Machinery and engines characterised both his fortified Isengard and his altered Shire arenas of influence. In this, he sought to emulate, or even surpass his ally, Sauron. This inclination was constitutional in them both from the very beginning.\n\nHis science also extended to biological areas. He is believed to have crossbred Men and Orcs, creating a new race of Orcs unafraid of daylight, the dreaded Uruk-hai, a major improvement on Sauron's thralls who hated daylight. His mannish spies in Bree were said to have Orc blood, giving them heightened senses over ordinary men. He also employed scavenger birds in his service, although this might also be attributed to [[Radagast]] the Brown, ordering them to report to Orthanc, Saruman's stronghold.\n\nBeing regarded as more powerful than Gandalf (at least before Gandalf's \"rebirth\"), it's fair to assume he would also wield explicit magic similar to Gandalf, such as artificial light, locking spells, creating fire, etc.\n\nSaruman, walking on the same ruinous path as Sauron, attempted to forge for himself a Ring of Power. This he wore during the War of the Ring which he revealed when he called himself \"Saruman the [[Ring-maker]]\".<ref name=\"FRCouncil\" /> He had great knowledge and lore of the magic rings created by Sauron and by the Elven-smiths, though at this time the full art of ring-making was lost and known only to Sauron and so Saruman's knowledge of the craft was incomplete. It is assumed that Saruman's Ring was the equivalent of one of the lesser rings in power and any details of this power are not mentioned. It is also assumed that it too lost its power, if it had any, when the One Ring was destroyed, since Saruman's craft of ring-making was still based on Sauron's. When Gandalf was given Narya, the Ring of Fire, Saruman learned of the gift and resented it. This may be another reason why Saruman desired to have a ring of his own.\n\n===Personality===\nSaruman resembled Gandalf not only in appearance, but originally also somewhat in deportment, but unlike Gandalf, Saruman was proud, even haughty, and in this he was more akin to Sauron. He saw himself as the most powerful of the Istari, expressing clear contempt for Radagast the Brown, patronising tolerance of the Wise and Elves, and sheer disdain for lesser Men. Saruman was no fool (though he saw Radagast as one); he realised Gandalf's power, and eventually came to see him as an equal, and later as a superior, much to his distress. He became jealous of Gandalf, eventually convincing himself that Gandalf was scheming against him, which justified his own scheming against Gandalf and the rest of the White Council, and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth as well. Saruman's ultimate agenda, in the end, was not very different at all from Sauron's, in that he himself ultimately sought to become a tyrant of Middle-earth; regardless if by his new master's side or (more preferably) on his own - if he attained the One Ring First. \n\nSaruman likely was true to his mission in the beginning, and actually believed in working to stop the return of the Darkness, but his pride and later arrogance (as well as his jealousy towards Gandalf and domination by Sauron) turned him into a traitor to the cause he had once served. Saruman's betrayal was not sudden, but slowly grew over time as Sauron used Saruman's lust for power, admiration of strength and envy as tools of control, until at last Saruman had convinced himself that he could not have taken any other path and that it was too late now to repent. To the last the corrupted Wizard only believed in his own counsel and the deceptive words of the Dark Lord. These false beliefs kept Saruman from taking his last chance at redemption, and because he must have realised this after Gandalf's truly generous terms he only became more bitter and filled with the rage of failure, blaming Gandalf more than anyone else for his downfall.\n\n==Politics==\n===Men===\nSaruman \"went mostly among men\". He always sought power, and it lay in the hands of the kingdoms of Men.\n\nNo records speak of his earliest journeys into the east; after his return he became a servant of Gondor, receiving the keys to Orthanc from Beren as its warden. When Gondor weakened, he claimed Orthanc for his own without any formal declaration (or objection from Gondor), yet remained nominally an ally of Gondor and of Rohan.<ref name=\"AppEorl\" /> \n\nWhen he turned to treachery, Saruman employed men mainly from Dunland, and agents from other lands, turning old grudges into fuel for new hatred. The Dunlendings were enticed with the old stories that they had once lived in [[Calenardhon]] before the ''Strawheads''. The Dunlendings became his soldiers and it also seems probable that he used some of them to create [[Half-orcs]].\n\nGríma Wormtongue played a vital role in Saruman's plans: with Saruman's counsel Gríma began to weaken the king, estranging him from his other counsellors and even his own kin, until Gríma had in effect become the leader of Rohan.\n\n===Elves=== \nSaruman was once on good terms with the Elves, and was voted in as the leader of the White Council, a group of Elves and Istari united against Sauron. \n\nSaruman knew that Gandalf had been given the third Elvish ring Narya by Círdan the Shipwright. This nurtured his jealousy of Gandalf and his resentment towards the Elves. \n\nSaruman had little use for, or interest in, the Elves, who were declining and their lands were few and secretive; although they wielded marvellous powers and two Rings of Power, they were not useful nor accessible for Saruman's ambitions. Also, they succumbed less easily than other races to manipulation. \n\nEven though Isengard lay very close to [[Lothlórien]], Saruman had very little or no contact with it. Saruman never trusted Galadriel and he accused her of scheming for Gandalf at his expense.<ref name=\"Partings\" />\n\n===Orcs===\nSaruman drew his original strength of Orcs from tribes in the [[Misty Mountains]], and perhaps from Moria Orcs. He made use of [[Wargs|Warg]]-mounted Orcs for raids against Rohan.\n\nHe also bred [[Orcs of Isengard|Orcs]] in the pits of Isengard, eventually creating crossbreeds of Orcs and Men (probably Dunlendings or [[Bree-men]]) This programme apparently also involved feeding these greater Orcs Man-flesh as a treat.\n\nHis Uruk-hai legions displayed great discipline and fierce loyalty, in addition to the other improvements such as height, strength, endurance and resistance to sunlight. There also appears to have been middle stages between Men and the Uruk-hai, Men with varying degrees of Orkish appearance such as [[Half-orcs]] and [[Goblin-men]]. These were reported by Pippin and Merry to have been part of Saruman's regular army, but were not Uruk-hai, since the hobbits would have recognised these from their earlier capture. \n\nSaruman's servants called him \"[[Sharkey]]\" both in Isengard and later in the Shire.<ref name=\"Scouring\" />\n\n===Ents/Trees===\nSaruman made contact with the Ents in Fangorn Forest shortly after he settled in Isengard. The oldest of the Ents, [[Treebeard]] received him and gave him free access to the forest.<ref name=\"Treebeard\">{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref>\n\nSaruman also consulted with Treebeard, learning much old lore that the Ents would have remembered from ancient times. Saruman did not return this favour, but only listened.<ref name=\"Treebeard\" />\n\nThe Ents saw Saruman's treachery early, and became very concerned, primarily with Saruman's Orcs felling trees on the edge of Fangorn for use in the furnaces of Isengard and sometimes for no reason at all. \n\nThe Ents also appear to have had a sense of order, how things should be, that Saruman encroached upon. The crossbreeding of Men and Orcs particularly alarmed them, out of proportion to other concerns enemies of Saruman might have had. Also alarming was the pure fact of his treachery — the Istari were supposed to have a special responsibility. \n\nSaruman used the Ents and the Fangorn forest without concern for the consequences. He clearly misjudged the Ents' abilities and will to act. This might not have been as incautious as it seemed, since major contributing factors to the Ent's actions were advice and requests from Gandalf, and concern about the rising power of Sauron (and their wish to support the front-line troops of the war, Rohan and Gondor). \n\nSaruman clearly had the ability to understand the minds of the Ents when he found it useful. He managed to talk Treebeard into setting him free from Orthanc by pushing just the right buttons — Ents dislike the concept of caging up any creature.\n\n===Hobbits===\nThe race of Hobbits and their lands seemed too insignificant to interest Saruman: until he took notice of Gandalf's special concern for them. Studying Gandalf made him focus gradually more and more on the Hobbits and The Shire. For a period he actually travelled there in secret, mapping out the lands. Gandalf was aware of this, but at this point only amused.\n\nHe began smoking pipe-weed (a habit of the Hobbits that Gandalf had picked up), also in secret. His demand for tobacco opened up trading between The Shire and Isengard, and the power his money could wield there and the corruption it could cause began to fascinate him. Some of his agents went in secret, and some were known to Gandalf and the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]].\n\nHis anger towards the Hobbits may possibly stem from the attention Gandalf showed them. It certainly strengthened immensely when he discovered that the Hobbits had \"conspired\" with Gandalf to keep the One Ring from him.\n\nThis, and the sudden urgency caused by the Ringwraiths' hunt for the Ring-bearer from The Shire to Rivendell, made him increase his activity in the area, leading to a build-up of power that would lead to virtual conquest of The Shire. \n\nHe might also later have blamed the ruin of Isengard by the Ents on Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck, who clearly catalysed events. \n\nThis all came together when Saruman escaped from the Ents and retired to The Shire and his thug regime in place there. It appears he immediately switched the focus of this operation to wanton destruction: pollution, murder, fire, chopping down trees for no reason, a last blow against Hobbits and Gandalf.\n\nAt his final utter defeat by [[Battle of Bywater|a Hobbit uprising]], his life was spared even when he tried to assassinate Frodo Baggins. At this moment he actually conceded a short-lived respect to Frodo.\n\n===Valar/Maiar/Wizards=== \nSaruman was supposedly eager to go to Middle-earth, against Manwë's counsel. After his 'death' he was apparently barred from returning to Valinor, and therefore was denied reincarnation and condemned to waft away and disappear like so much smoke.<ref name=\"Scouring\">{{FR|Scouring}}, p. 1020</ref> In his corrupt state, Saruman sought power and the imposing of order in Middle-earth by any means necessary, even if it meant betraying the mission he was entrusted with and throwing in his lot with Sauron.\n\nSauron, in origin a Maia of Aulë like Saruman, awed and frightened him. During the height of his arrogance, Saruman thought he could contend with Sauron, but in the end he found himself meddling with a spirit of far greater power and knowledge than himself. Caught peering into the ''palantír'' he was seduced by Sauron to his allegiance, no longer opposing (and perhaps even desiring) his victory. The Wizard sought to become the quasi-equal lieutenant to Sauron and receive his favour in triumph, yet he was proved to be a duplicitous ally by actively coveting the One Ring. After the Escape of Gandalf, Saruman understood the only paths ahead of him were to: show Sauron his loyalty by crippling Rohan, hoping to at the very least be spared, or claim the Ring first; otherwise he would come to ruin and torment. \n\nSaruman grudgingly brought with him Radagast as a companion from Valinor, at the request of Yavanna, yet still managed to arrive alone, and first. Shortly after, he went into the East with the two Blue Wizards, and later returned alone. There he may have wrought many great works to diminish the influence of the Enemy or searched for lore to help him in his schemes.\n\nRadagast, even though Saruman scorned him, served both Gandalf and Saruman very usefully (and wholly unintentionally, as he admitted \"he had just the wit to play the part I set him\", that of persuading Gandalf to come to Isengard).<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 258</ref> Radagast also sent birds to Saruman and Gandalf to report the different happenings in Middle-earth. \n\nSaruman had always been jealous of Gandalf, and knew that he was keeping secrets from him, such as his suspicion about Bilbo's ring and Narya, secret. Gandalf also suspected Saruman of plotting to gain the One Ring for himself, and hinted at this at a meeting of the White Council. Gandalf blew nine small smoke rings and one great one that wavered a bit, seeming almost palpable, and yet blew away, symbolising (almost prophetic of) Saruman's failure in achieving the One. In general, Saruman must have viewed Gandalf as his only peer, and as such to be feared and treated with (although not necessarily shown) respect. He always kept a watchful eye open for Gandalf's doings, and actually picked up the habit of smoking pipe-weed by sending out spies tailing Gandalf to the Shire. After revealing his fealty to Mordor and his desire for the Ring, Saruman offered Gandalf the chance to join with Sauron, or perhaps get the One for themselves. Ultimately, certain that Gandalf could be forced to tell of the Ring's whereabouts or that at least Sauron would prevail, he came to underestimate Gandalf and think little of his interventions.\n\nNevertheless, Saruman exercised more power than Gandalf, even with the ring Narya, as became clear when he placed Gandalf under arrest at the pinnacle of Orthanc. The text does not make it clear whether Saruman lost power or whether Gandalf gained power, but when Gandalf returned as \"Gandalf [[the White]]\", he could summon Saruman at his will, forcibly keep him in his presence, and finally break Saruman's staff (with whatever implications that might have had for Saruman's powers). \n\nDespite his apparent disdain for the Grey Pilgrim, Saruman several times came very close to setting aside his pride and asking Gandalf for pity and help. The closest call came when the Ringwraiths (on their way to the Shire) arrived at Isengard while Gandalf still remained in captivity there. Saruman, realising he might have already lost Sauron's trust, actually went to seek Gandalf's pardon, only to find his erstwhile captive missing from the top of Orthanc.\n\n===Animals===\nSaruman had control over many birds, probably having been taught to tame them by Radagast.

From early on in the production, it was decided that \"Saruman\" and \"[[Sauron]]\" sounded too much alike, and might confuse viewers. On concept art, Saruman is called Ruman,<ref>[http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=69 1978 - The Lord of the Rings Gallery] at [http://www.ralphbakshi.com Ralphbakshi.com] (accessed 26 March 2011)</ref> but prior to recording, this was changed to Aruman. However, during recording, it was again changed, to \"Saruman\". Because of this late change, several instances of \"Aruman\" remain in the finished film.\n\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Saruman was played by [[Christopher Lee]]. Saruman's depiction in the series is more akin to the early drafts: he is a more committed vassal of Sauron; still, he is seemingly not above cheating his master, instructing [[Lurtz]] to bring him the Hobbits carrying \"something of great value\" (the [[The One Ring|One Ring]]). In the films, his corruption by Sauron is directly portrayed to have come about through his use of one of the ''[[Palantíri]]'' found in the tower of [[Orthanc]], through which Sauron fueled the lust for power and accompanying arrogance and greed already festering in Saruman's heart. The films did not include the [[Scouring of the Shire]], so Saruman's last appearance was in [[Isengard]], during his encounter with [[Gandalf]] and Théoden. In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|extended edition of ''The Return of the King'']], [[Gríma]] stabs Saruman in the back, causing him to fall on a spiked wheel below the tower of Orthanc.\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Christopher Lee reprised his role as Saruman, although the character does not appear in the book.<ref name=\"TelegraphCasting\">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8311016/Christopher-Lee-will-star-in-the-Hobbit-prequel.html|articlename=Christopher Lee will star in the Hobbit prequel|dated=08-Feb-2011|website=[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ The Telegraph]|accessed=21-Dec-2011}}</ref> He appears as part of the [[White Council]] alongside Gandalf, [[Galadriel]], and [[Elrond]]. He is sceptical about the appearance of a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] in [[Dol Guldur]]. However, when he participates in the attack on Dol Guldur, he sees for himself that Sauron has indeed returned. After the skirmish, he appears shaken by the display of Sauron's power, but claims he will take it upon himself to keep an eye on the Dark Lord and pretends to care for Lady Galadriel's weakened state.\n\n'''2024: ''[[The War of the Rohirrim]]'':''' \n:Christopher Lee posthumously voices Saruman through an archival recording. Saruman appears at the end of the film, introduced to the newly crowned king, [[Fréaláf Hildeson]], as the newly appointed master of Isengard, and he assures Fréaláf that Rohan has Isengard's support.\n\n===Television===\n'''1993: ''[[Hobitit]]'':'''\n:Saruman was played by actor Mikko Kivinen. He appears only in the \"Vanha metsä\" (\"Old Forest\") episode.\n\n===Radio series===\n'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Saruman is provided by [[Robert Farquharson]].\n\n'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Saruman is provided by [[James Arrington]].\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:''' \n:[[Peter Howell]] played Saruman. Because the series follows a chronological timeline rather than the flashbacks of the books, Saruman's betrayal is brought out much sooner than in the book. Excerpts from \"[[The Hunt for the Ring]]\" are dramatised to flesh out Gandalf's escape from Isengard, and the [[Nazgûl]]'s pursuit. The hobbits do not meet him on the road back to Rivendell. In the final episode, Saruman's death at the hands of Wormtongue at [[Bag End]] is included.\n\n'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''\n:Saruman is played by Manfred Steffen.\n\n'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Saruman is provided by Andrej Hryc. Saruman appears in all three series (seasons) of this adaptation, with his most prominent appearances in the episodes covering ''The Two Towers''.\n\n===Games===\n'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Though Christopher Lee provided the voice of Saruman for many scenes, the only visual appearance of the Wizard of from re-used movie clips, his voice is played over several of Gandalf's actions.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Saruman is one of the \"Hero\" units of the Servants of Sauron, the game also depicts his creation of the Uruk-hai.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:Saruman is the main \"Hero\" unit of the Isengard faction, the evil campaign follows his despoilment of both Isengard and the [[Fangorn Forest]], war on [[Rohan]] and later conquest of the outlying lands.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Saruman is still the main \"Hero\" unit of the Isengard faction but plays no role in the storyline.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard]]'':'''\n:Though frequently referred to in-game since 2007, Saruman made no visual appearance until 2011 and the ''Rise of Isengard'' expansion. Many quests in the game display the stretch of the [[White Hand]] - Saruman's minions are present in the Shire as early as {{TA|3018}}, as well as [[Bree-land]], [[Lone-lands]], [[Eregion]], [[Enedwaith]], [[Dunland]], [[Gap of Rohan]], outskirts of the Fangorn Forest and even [[Moria]].\n:In the storyline of ''Rise of Isengard'' Saruman first appears buying the loyalties of the [[Dunlendings|Dunlending]] clans, bringing with him riches and maintaining a friendly appearance. He also still keeps his affairs in Rohan private, to the point that when a [[Rohirrim]] questions the desolation of [[Nan Curunír|''Nan Curunír'']] and the presence of [[Trolls]] in Isengard, the Wizard manages to use his voice to convince him that it was all for the good cause. At one point, traitorous Dunlendings capture the player and send him to Saruman as a gift - once again the Wizard maintains a friendly and noble appearance, trying to discern the location of The Ring, before the player escapes.\n:A major storyline is derived from a single line in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', where Saruman calls himself \"Ring-forger\". Long having researched the [[Rings of Power]], Saruman sends his minions to pillage what remains of Ring-Forges of Eregion, looking for any knowledge of ancient [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain|Elven smiths]] that have remained here. Using that lore, he constructs a massive Ring-Forge under Isengard, where he creates five lesser rings and a master one to command them. He keeps the master ring to himself and gives the other to his most trusted lieutenants, though none of the mortals are prepared for it and are turned into monstrosities. A large force of players defeats them one by one, reclaiming lesser rings and later use those rings to turn upon the master one. In the ensuing fight Saruman's ring is destroyed shortly before the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Hornburg]], and with it the lesser ones lose their power.\n\n'''2014: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''\n:Voiced by [[Roger Jackson]], Saruman appears in this game as a non-playable character. The game's protagonist, [[Talion]], finds various artefacts that reveal that Saruman's spies are active within the borders of Mordor in the years between ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It is later revealed that Saruman was controlling Queen Marwen of the [[Nurnen]] to hinder Sauron while bringing about the destruction of the men of [[Nurn]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=maiar\n|house=[[Maiar|Maia]] of [[Aulë]]\n|born=[[Creation of the Ainur]]\n|died=[[3 November]], {{TA|3019}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|prev=Position established\n|pvac=None\n|list=Chief of the [[Wizards|Istari]]\n|dates=c. {{TA|1000}} - [[5 March]], {{TA|3019|n}}\n|next=[[Gandalf]]\n}}\n{{seq\n|prev=Unknown\n|list=[[Lord of Isengard|Lord]] of [[Isengard]]\n|dates={{TA|2759}} - [[15 August]], {{TA|3019|n}}\n|nvac=None\n|next=''[[Aragorn|Elessar]] granted Isengard to the [[Ents]]''\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{ainur}}\n{{hobbitfilms}}\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Maiar]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Smiths]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]\n[[de:Saruman]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/ainur/maiar/istari/saruman]]\n[[fi:Saruman]]",

That is how he got his name, though he always called himself 'my precious.'||''[[The Hobbit]]'', \"[[Riddles in the Dark]]\"|J.R.R. Tolkien - Gollum Quote.mp3}}\n'''Gollum''', also known as '''Sméagol''', was a creature (originally a [[Stoors|Stoorish]] [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]) who bore [[the One Ring]]. He lived in the [[Misty Mountains]] for most of his life. In {{TA|2941}} he lost the Ring to [[Bilbo Baggins]]. For the rest of his life he sought to recover his \"precious\" \"birthday present\". In {{TA|3019}} he followed the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and met [[Frodo Baggins]]. After leading Frodo into [[Mordor]] and betraying him to [[Shelob]] he finally seized the Ring in [[Cracks of Doom|Sammath Naur]]. In his euphoria he died and destroyed the Ring after falling into the fires of [[Mount Doom]].\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nSméagol was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[Stoors|Stoorish]] race who lived on the banks of the [[Anduin]] in the later [[Third Age]], during the time of the [[Watchful Peace]], when [[Sauron]] was in the [[East]]. He belonged to a reputable family led by a stern and wise matriarch, his grandmother.<ref name=ta/><ref name=shadow/>\n\nHe had some amount of education in lore, as during his youth he learned of the events concerning the [[War of the Last Alliance]].<ref name=Passage>{{TT|IV2}}</ref> He also knew the [[riddle-game]], and riddles that were known to the Stoors' cousins in [[the Shire]].<ref name=shadow/><ref name=riddles>{{H|Riddles}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Sméagol and the Ring.jpg|left|thumb|''Sméagol and the Ring'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\n\nAround the year {{TA|2463}}, on his birthday, his friend (and close relative) [[Déagol]] offered him a cheap present.<ref name=L214>{{L|214}}</ref> Later that day they went boating in the [[Gladden Fields]]. As Sméagol was nosing around on the banks, Déagol was pulled into the water by a large fish, and found a gold ring. Sméagol demanded the ring as a birthday present and strangled Deágol when he refused, hiding his body.<ref name=shadow/> He thus became the fourth [[Ring-bearers|Ringbearer]], succeeding Sauron, [[Isildur]], and Déagol.<ref name=ta>{{app|TA}}</ref>\n\nAfter this incident, Sméagol returned home, telling no one of what had happened or what he had obtained. Discovering the Ring's power of invisibility, he used it for malicious purposes, spying on the other Stoors and learning their secrets. Soon he became unpopular and his peers avoided him; they often cursed and kicked him, and he bit their feet. Becoming a loner, he muttered to himself and gurgled in his throat, for which they called him \"gollum\", and he survived by stealing. Eventually even his grandmother, desiring peace, cast him out of the family [[hobbit-hole]].<ref name=shadow/>\n\n===Exile===\n[[File:Cor Blok - Gollum Goes into Hiding.jpg|thumb|\"Gollum Goes into Hiding\" by [[Cor Blok]]]]\nFollowing his exile, Sméagol wandered up the Anduin and followed a stream to some deep pools. He lived on fish, which he ate raw. After some time, the [[sun]] began to burn his skin and eyes, leading him to seek shelter in the caves from which the stream issued, high in the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=shadow/>\n\nThe Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body and mind and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limit. The murder of Déagol haunted him, and he reassured himself by imagining that the Ring had been given to him by his grandmother as a birthday present. He began talking to the Ring constantly, calling it his \"[[precious]]\".<ref name=shadow/>\n\n[[File:Michael Hague - Riddles in the Dark.jpg|thumb|right|''Riddles in the Dark'' by [[Michael Hague]]]]\n\nFor over four hundred years he lived on a small island surrounded by a subterranean [[Gollum's lake|lake]]. He lived mostly on raw fish that he caught from his raft, though he sometimes managed to lay his hands on [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Goblins]] that had strayed from [[Goblin-town]]. In later years he began to find Hobbit and [[Elves|Elven]] food repulsive. The Ring's corrupting influence as well as centuries of isolation in the Misty Mountains took a deep toll on him both physically and mentally. He became disfigured and grotesque in appearance, and by the time he met the Hobbit [[Bilbo Baggins]] he was afflicted with almost complete madness.\n\n===Loss of the Ring===\nIn {{TA|2941}}, during the [[Quest of Erebor]], Bilbo stumbled upon the Ring in the network of caves leading to Gollum's lake, Gollum having dropped it while hunting Goblins. It is possible that the Ring had a part in this, for it was known to have a will of its own. As [[Gandalf]] said later, the [[Necromancer]] was becoming more powerful, and it was a good time for the Ring to change hands and get back to Sauron.<ref name=shadow/> \n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gollum is Defeated.jpg|thumb|left|''Gollum is Defeated'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\nWhile still unaware of his loss, Gollum met Bilbo and engaged in the famous [[riddle-game]]. Gandalf later remarked that a small part of Gollum was glad to see another Hobbit for the first time in many years, but that this only made the evil part of him angrier.<ref name=shadow/> Following the game, Gollum refused to show Bilbo the promised way out and instead plotted to kill him. Before he could carry this out, he realized his \"precious\" was gone. Enraged, he gave Bilbo chase. The latter inadvertently stumbled upon the Ring's power of invisibility as he ran, allowing him to follow Gollum to the cave exit. There, Bilbo thought to kill Gollum, but pity struck him, so he instead jumped over him and fled.<ref>{{FR|Ring}}</ref>\n\n===Into the wild===\nGollum spent a further three years skulking in the mountains,<ref name=ta/> but his longing for the Ring eventually overcame his hatred of sunlight, and so he sallied forth in search of Bilbo. Travelling by night, he passed through [[Mirkwood]] and reached [[Lake-town]] and [[Dale]]. He spent his time there spying and eavesdropping, which allowed him to learn more of Bilbo. He then headed in the direction of the Shire, but before he could cross the [[Great River]], he suddenly turned southwards. Gandalf had been tracking him all the while with the help of the [[Elves of Mirkwood]], but he gave up the chase at this time, something he would later regret.<ref name=shadow/>\n\nNews of [[Sauron]]'s resurgence had drawn Gollum towards [[Mordor]], in the foolish hope that the Enemy might help him wreak his revenge. After some thirty years of wandering he reached the [[Mountains of Shadow]], and met [[Shelob]].<ref name=ta/> Upon venturing into Mordor itself, he was captured and tortured by Sauron, who thereby learned that the Ring had been recovered and was in the possession of a Shire Hobbit. Meanwhile, Gandalf had begun to suspect that Bilbo's ring was the One Ring, which led him to resume his search for Gollum. In {{TA|3017}}, Gollum was set free, only to be caught at last by [[Aragorn]] in the [[Dead Marshes]], and turned over to Gandalf. Gandalf spent many \"weary days\" interrogating him, following which he placed him in the care of [[Thranduil]].<ref name=ta/>\n\n===War of the Ring===\nIn {{TA|3018}}, Orcs raided the Elves of Mirkwood, allowing Gollum to escape. He entered [[Moria]], but was unable to open the [[Doors of Durin]]. Some months later, the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] passed through Moria, and Gollum began trailing it. When the Fellowship broke at [[Nen Hithoel]], Gollum followed [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] into the [[Emyn Muil]]. After a confrontation in which he bit and nearly strangled Sam, Frodo subdued him. Frodo tied an [[Elves|Elvish]] rope around Gollum's ankle for a leash, but the mere touch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Gollum swore by the \"precious\" itself to do so, and Frodo released him. The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made its way to the [[Black Gate]], the entrance to Mordor.\n\nFrodo's kindness brought out what remained of Gollum's better side, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. The two had a strange sort of bond from having both been Ringbearers; in Gollum, Frodo saw his possible future, and so wanted to save him so he could save himself. Gollum feared Frodo, and also thought that helping him would deprive Sauron of the Ring.\n\nWhen the Black Gate was reached and found to be well-guarded, Gollum convinced Frodo and Sam to follow him south, where he knew of another entrance into Mordor. Before they could reach it, Frodo and Sam were captured by [[Faramir]]. Gollum followed the captives to the secret outpost of [[Henneth Annûn]], where he was spotted. Faramir then forced Frodo to aid Faramir's men in capturing the creature, a betrayal that Gollum felt keenly. While questioning Gollum, Faramir learned that the place to which he had been leading the Hobbits was [[Cirith Ungol]]. He warned Frodo and Sam that this was a place of great evil and that their guide was not to be trusted.\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gollum at the Forbidden Pool.jpg|thumb|''Gollum at the Forbidden Pool'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\nUpon regaining their freedom, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum set out again for Mordor and reached the pass of Cirith Ungol. One night, Gollum visited the great spider [[Shelob]], because he was planning to betray the Hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself. When he returned the Hobbits were asleep. The sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to Gollum, and all hope of redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into [[Shelob's Lair]]. For this service to Shelob, the Orcs of Cirith Ungol referred to him as \"her sneak\".\n\nJust as Frodo warned him, Gollum's breach of his oath ultimately led to his undoing, for Frodo and Sam escaped from Shelob's lair and came against all odds to the volcano [[Mount Doom]]. Gollum followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, he attacked, but failed to get the Ring. Sam, who had hated Gollum on sight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but relented out of sheer pity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten creature.\n\nMoments later, Frodo fell victim to the Ring's power and put it on his finger instead of casting it into the [[Cracks of Doom]] as he had meant to. Then Gollum attacked again. The two fought while Frodo was invisible and finally Gollum bit off Frodo's finger.\n\nHere Frodo's kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded, for Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, lost his balance and fell in, taking the Ring and finger with him with a last cry of \"Preciouss!\". Had Gollum not lived to play this final part, there would have been a good chance that Sauron would have regained the Ring, as he knew where Frodo was as soon as he put the Ring on.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - The Stairs of Cirith Ungol.jpg|left|thumb|''The Stairs of Cirith Ungol'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nSméagol was a Hobbit, but he spent long centuries in darkness and damp, influenced by the power of the Ring. It is possible that thanks to his hardy Hobbitish nature that he was not reduced to a [[Wraiths|wraith]].<ref>\n{{webcite|author=Stan Brown|website=FAQ of the Rings|articleurl=http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q1-GollumWraith|articlename=Why hadn’t Gollum turned into a wraith long ago?}}</ref> However, he was reduced to a small, extremely thin and wiry person, with scrawny neck, pale skin, flat feet, long thin hands with clammy fingers, and large pale or green eyes that seemed to glow. His sense of sight, as well as his hearing and smelling, was very good, due to the time he spent underground.\n\nHe could move and climb silently like a spider, and although he had only six teeth left,<ref>{{H|5}}</ref> he could give deep bites, even able to bite off Frodo's finger.\n\n===Personality===\nSméagol was quick and strong, the most inquisitive and curious-minded of his community. He was interested in roots and beginnings. He owed [[#Etymology|his name]] to his interest in roots and deep pools; he dove, burrowed and tunnelled under trees, plants, and mounds. He tended to neglect anything that was higher, like the flowers, the trees and looking at the hills.<ref name=shadow/>\n\nDuring his centuries of loneliness and under the Ring's influence, he seems to have developed something similar to a personality disorder: his \"Gollum\" personality was a slave to the Ring and would kill for it, overwhelming his former self, who still vaguely remembered things like friendship and love. Not having anyone else to speak to, he often quarreled with himself. Gollum both loved and hated the Ring and himself. He often referred both to the Ring and himself as \"my Precious\", perhaps confusing the two entities.<ref name=guide/>\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Endgame on the Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|''Endgame on the Mountain'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\nYears later, [[Samwise Gamgee]] would give two nickname to Gollum. Originally, Sam used the name Slinker to refer to Gollum's slinking around before they had captured him.<ref>{{TT|Taming}}, p. 604</ref> He then came to use Slinker and Stinker to refer to the two contrasting sides of Gollum's personality,<ref name=gate/> caused by possession of the [[One Ring]] for so long.<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}, pp. 53-5</ref> Slinker was the fawning, desperate, and eager-to-please, \"Sméagol\" side demeanour; and Stinker was the plotting and sinister \"Gollum\" side of him.<ref name=gate>{{TT|Gate}}, p. 638</ref> When he first came into the service of [[Frodo Baggins]] his Slinker side was more prominent but the closer they got to the [[Black Gate]] the more the Stinker side started to take over and Slinker became more like Stinker and Sam started using the name to generally refer to Gollum.<ref>{{TT|Stairs}}, p. 714</ref>\n\nOther aspects of the Ring's corruption was the aversion to all living creatures, especially the [[Elves]] and all things Elven. The [[Elven rope]] burnt his skin, and [[lembas]] tasted like dust to him and choked him.\n\nSméagol, as a Hobbit, was perhaps good at heart, but he was relatively greedy and mean.<ref name=L214/> Bilbo was corrupted far more slowly by the Ring because his adventures with it began with an act of mercy, while Gollum began his with murder.<ref name=shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Turner Mohan - The Ringbearers.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Ringbearers'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\n\n''Sméagol'' is the translation of an actual [[Westron]] name ''[[Trahald]]'', the meaning of which was \"burrowing, worming in\" or \"apt to creep into a hole\". In both [[Westron]] and Old English, Sméagol's name is related to [[Smaug]]'s: Smaug's name in \"true [[language of Dale|Dalish]]\"{{Fact}} was ''[[Trāgu]]'', and the ''Trah-'' stem in ''Trahald'' and ''Trâgu'' is thus an analogue of the Germanic stem present in both ''Sméagol'' and ''Smaug''.\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] explained in his \"[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\" the origin of the name ''Sméagol'' in the lemma on [[smials]]:\n{{blockquote|'''Smials'''. A word peculiar to hobbits (not Common Speech), meaning 'burrow'; leave unchanged. It is a form that the Old English word '''smygel''' 'burrow' might have had, if it had survived. The same element appears in Gollum's real name, '''Sméagol'''.}}\n\nThe name ''[[Smaug]]'', which means \"squeezed through a hole\", is thus related.<ref>{{L|31}}</ref>\n\n===Pronunciation===\n{{Pronounce|Anglo-Saxon - Sméagol.mp3|Gilgamesh}}\nIn both the 1981 BBC radio adaptation and in Peter Jackson's films ''Sméagol'' is pronounced as \"SMEE-gol\", although the placement of the acute accent suggests that the correct pronunciation is \"SMAY-uh-gol\". On the other hand, in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s recordings of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' he also pronounced it \"SMEE-gol\" or \"SMEE-AH-GOL\", suggesting that ''éa'' should either be pronounced as a long \"i\"-sound or as a diphthong ''ea'', and not as two distinct vowels \"e\" and \"a\".<ref>{{webcite|author=J.R.R. Tolkien|website=J.R.R. Tolkien reads from 'The Lord of the Rings' #1|articleurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBQJTaMMMhI&feature=youtu.be&t=95|articlename=J.R.R. Tolkien reads from 'The Lord of the Rings' #1}}</ref> Tolkien had a habit in his writing to put diacritics in varying places, as can also be seen in the name ''[[Eärendil]]'', which also occurs spelt ''Ëarendil''.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the first edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Gollum did not appear quite as wretched or as bound to the Ring. Tolkien revised this characterisation to fit the concept of the Ruling Ring developed during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien then explained the version given in the first edition as a lie that Bilbo made up to tell the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] and [[Gandalf]].<ref name=\"Christensen\">[[Bonniejean Christensen]], [[Jared Lobdell]] (ed.), \"Gollum's Character Transformation in ''The Hobbit''\", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'', pages 7-26</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', it is mentioned that [[the One Ring]] was found \"''ere the Kings failed in Gondor''\". This can mean that originally, Gollum's age was intended to be considerably more than six hundred years (further reinforced by certain places in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' like Gollum referring to tales about an uncorrupted [[Minas Ithil]] or Gandalf comparing his people to \"fathers of the fathers of the [[Stoors]]\"). In fact it seems likely that Sauron leaving the Mirkwood in 2063 T.A. and some Hobbits settling there after that are details added for the purpose of making the smaller age possible; perhaps in order to make it possible for Gollum and the other characters to have the same language.\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[John Garth]] has suggested that the character of Gollum carries echoes of the \"''night-haunting, man-eating''\" [[Ogres|ogre]] [[Wikipedia:Grendel|Grendel]] in ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John Garth]]|articleurl=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/05/j-r-r-tolkien-beowulf-one-mans-passion-threshold-between-myth-and-reality|articlename=J R R Tolkien's Beowulf: one man's passion for the threshold between myth and reality|dated=29 May 2014|website=[http://www.newstatesman.com/ newstatesman.com]|accessed=29 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Gollum in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Hobbit (1967 film) - Gollum.jpg|[[The Hobbit (1967 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1967 film)]]\nFile:The Hobbit (1977 film) - Gollum.jpg|[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Gollum.jpg|[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:David T.

The ground-breaking CGI character was built around Serkis's voice, movements and expressions, sometimes by using a motion capture suit which recorded his movements and applied them to the digital character, and sometimes by the more laborious process of digitally \"painting out\" Serkis's image and replacing it with Gollum's. In one such shot in ''The Two Towers'', Serkis' real spittle can be seen emerging from Gollum's mouth.\n\n:In ''The Return of the King'' Serkis himself appears in a flashback scene as Sméagol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for ''The Two Towers'' but held back because it was felt that audiences would relate better to the original Sméagol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Gollum's face had to be redesigned for the second and third movies so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'.\n\n'''2012: [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]:'''\n:[[Andy Serkis]] reprised his role as Gollum.<ref name=\"PJCasting1\">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168211921558|articlename=Production begins in New Zealand on The Hobbit|dated=20-March-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=21-Dec-2011}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n'''1993: ''[[Hobitit]]'':'''\n:Gollum is depicted as an old, white creature, portrayed by [[Kari Väänänen]], the same actor who played [[Aragorn]] in the series.\n\n===Radio series===\n'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Gollum is provided by [[Gerik Schjelderup]].<ref name=\"RT1723\">Radio Times, Volume 133, No. 1723, [[16 November|November 16]], [[1956]]</ref>\n\n'''1968: [[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|''The Hobbit'' (1968 radio series)]]:'''\n:The narrator refers to Gollum (voiced by [[Wolfe Morris]]) as \"Galloom\", even though Gollum himself manages to pronounce his name correctly.

He was the last of the Second Line.<ref name=\"Mark\">{{App|Mark}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nThéoden was the only son of [[Thengel]], the heir of king [[Fengel]] of [[Rohan]], and [[Morwen of Lossarnach]], a descendant of a former [[Prince of Dol Amroth|prince]] of the fief of [[Belfalas]].<ref name=\"Mark\" /><ref name=\"Linear\">{{UT|Linear}}</ref> His father left Rohan when he came to manhood and lived long in Gondor. Théoden had been born in [[Gondor]] and spent at least the first five years of his life there with his mother and father until his father was called back to Rohan after the death of Théoden's grandfather Fengel.\n\n[[Westron]],<ref name=\"DwarvesIntro\">{{PM|XIntro}}</ref> the \"speech of Gondor\", was used in his father's house in Rohan<ref name=\"Mark\" />{{rp|1069}}. Théoden spoke Westron as his native language<ref name=\"DwarvesIntro\" /> and he also spoke [[Rohanese]] and [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 2, p. 316</ref> It is not known if Sindarin and Rohanese were his native languages or his acquired languages. His mother Morwen was a \"lady of Gondor of high Númenórean descent\".<ref name=\"Linear\" /> In Gondor all men of high lineage and all those who learned how to read and write used Sindarin, even as a daily language, and it is said that in some families Sindarin was the native language.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 296</ref>\n\nThéoden loved his sister [[Théodwyn]] dearly. After she and her husband both died he adopted her children [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]] as his own. He had a son, [[Théodred]], whose mother [[Elfhild]] died in childbirth.<ref name=\"Mark\" />\n\nThéoden became king after the death of his father in {{TA|2980}}.<ref name=\"Mark\" />\n\nIn {{TA|3014}} Théoden's health began to fail. This was caused by the spells of [[Saruman|Saruman the White]].<ref name=\"Mark\" /> This may have been due to natural causes as he was then sixty-six, though Rohirrim often lived past eighty, or it may have been induced or increased by subtle poisons administered by [[Gríma]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> Gríma (or ''Wormtongue'' as most others in the [[Riddermark|Mark]] called him), was secretly in the employ of Saruman.\n\n===War of the Ring===\nAs the war approached Théoden was increasingly misled by his chief adviser Gríma. In the last years before the War of the Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands completely, and Gríma became increasingly powerful. Rohan was troubled again by [[Orcs]] and [[Dunlendings]], who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from [[Isengard]]. \n\nHis only son, Théodred, had only recently been slain by Saruman's forces during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. Théoden ordered Éomer against hunting Orcs that crossed Rohan but Éomer went to the foray against his orders.<ref name=\"appB\">{{App|Great}}</ref> On Gríma's orders Éomer had been arrested and imprisoned for this.<ref name=\"Hall\">{{TT|III6}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]] appeared before him on [[2 March]], the [[Wizards|Wizard]] healed the king. He then restored his nephew, who would become his heir, took up his [[Herugrim|sword]], and led the [[Rohirrim|Riders of Rohan]] to the [[Fords of Isen]], against Saruman.<ref name=\"appB\" /> \n\nOn their way, they received news that [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen|the border was lost]] and he retreated into [[Helm's Deep]] where they were attacked by Saruman's forces on [[3 March]].<ref name=\"appB\" /> Théoden won the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] and after this he became known as '''Théoden Ednew''', the Renewed,<ref name=\"Mark\" /> because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Théoden visited [[Isengard]], where he witnessed [[Gandalf]] deposing Saruman from [[Wizards|their order]]. During the parley before the tower of [[Orthanc]], [[Saruman]] attempted to deceive Théoden with false offers of peace and friendship. When Théoden rejected him, [[Saruman]] mockingly referred to him as a \"'''Horsemaster'''\" as an insult<ref>{{TT|III10}}</ref><ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>. On their way back to Rohan, they stopped by the [[Helm's Deep]], where he noticed that the lonely [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of their company, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] felt out of place, and offered to ride with him for the rest of the journey. The hobbit was delighted, as he felt useless among the Riders and offered Théoden his sword in service of Rohan.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>\n\nOn [[6 March]] Théoden and the Riders left Hornburg for [[Harrowdale]] taking a safe path to Edoras, and soon after [[Aragorn]] left the Rohirrim's company for [[Dunharrow]].<ref name=\"appB\" /> Near the outer hills of Rohan, Théoden dismissed Éomer's urge not to go to the war, and with the remaining Riders he rode to the Hold of Dunharrow where his people took shelter at [[Dunharrow]].<ref name=\"muster\">{{RK|V3}}</ref>\n\n===Fulfilling the Oath of Eorl===\n[[File:Paula DiSante - The Red Arrow.JPG|thumb|[[Paula DiSante]] - ''The Red Arrow'']]\nAfter reuniting with Éowyn and while resting, a [[Gondorian]] named [[Hirgon]] entered his tent, bringing the [[Red Arrow]] from [[Denethor]] II. Théoden responded to him that 6000 Riders would reach [[Minas Tirith]] in the week. Indeed they set off the [[Dawnless Day|next morning]]; before leaving he ordered his squire, Meriadoc, to stay behind at Edoras.<ref name=\"muster\" />\n\nOn their way to Minas Tirith, Théoden's forces were alerted to a host of Orcs upon the road from the city moving towards them. A leader of the [[Woses]], [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]], offered to lead the Rohirrim by secret paths through the [[Drúadan Forest]] so they could avoid the Orcs. Taking the forgotten road down [[Stonewain Valley]] the riders of Rohan were able to come to the [[Pelennor Fields]] undetected.\n[[File:Abe Papakhian - The Ride of the Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abe Papakhian]] - ''The Ride of the Rohirrim'']]\nTo his dismay, they found Hirgon dead and understood that the Gondorians were unaware of their arrival; Minas Tirith [[Siege of Gondor|was being destroyed]]. Théoden was reinvigorated by a sudden great flash of light from the city. He ordered to charge as the [[Storm of Mordor|Darkness]] was fading. He led the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In that battle he challenged a chieftain of the [[Haradrim]] who led their cavalry and had a standard with a \"black serpent upon scarlet\", and unhorsed him and hewed down his standard-bearer.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>\n[[File:Angus McBride - Eowyn against Witch-king.gif|thumb|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Eowyn against Witch-king'']]\nThe [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] attacked him, and he was mortally wounded when his horse [[Snowmane]] fell upon him after being frightened by the Ringwraith's [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]].\n\nHe was immediately avenged by Éowyn and the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], both of whom had ridden to war in secret. He claimed to Merry at his death on the field that he was satisfied, for he had felled the Black Serpent.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe body of Théoden the Renowned remained in the [[Hallows]] of Minas Tirith<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> while [[Snowmane]] was buried where they fell.\n\nHis nephew Éomer succeeded him as King of Rohan. In [[July]] he returned to Minas Tirith and brought Théoden's body back to [[Edoras]]. On [[10 August]], the funeral of Théoden took place. [[Gléowine]] composed a poem for him and other Kings of the line of [[Eorl]].<ref name=\"partings\">{{RK|VI6}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Théoden'' is derived from the [[Old English]] word ''[[Wiktionary:þeoden|þeoden]]'', which means \"chief of a people\", \"prince\" or \"king\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 368</ref> The word ''þeoden'' contains the element ''þeod'', which means \"people\".<ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Bosworth|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/31679|articlename=þeóden, n.|website=Bowsworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary online|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref> \n\nHis epithet ''Ednew'' is derived from the Old English word ''edneowe'', which means \"renewed\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 705</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Bosworth|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/8891|articlename=ed-neowe, adj.|website=Bowsworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary online|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref>\n\nIn Tolkien's fictional etymology, the name ''Théoden'' is an Old English translation of the original [[Rohanese]] ''Tûrac'', an old word for King.<ref name=\"PM\">{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, $54</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | FEN | | | | | | | | | | | | |FEN=[[Fengel]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2870|n}} - {{TA|2953|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | DAU | | THE |y| MOR | | | | | | | | |DAU=''two daughters''<br/><small>''unknown''</small>|THE=[[Thengel]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2905|n}} - {{TA|2980|n}}''</small>|MOR=[[Morwen Steelsheen]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2922|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | ELF |y| THE | | DAU | | THW |y| EOM | | |ELF=[[Elfhild]]<br/><small>''d. {{TA|2978|n}}''</small>|THE='''THÉODEN'''<br/><small>''{{TA|2948|n}} - {{TA|3019|n}}''†</small>|DAU=''three daughters''<br/><small>''unknown''</small>|THW=[[Théodwyn]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2963|n}} - {{TA|3002|n}}''</small>|EOM=[[Éomund]]<br/><small>''d. {{TA|3002|n}}''†</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | THE | | LOT |y| EOM | | EOW |y| FAR |THE=[[Théodred]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2978|n}} - {{TA|3019|n}}''†</small>|LOT=[[Lothíriel]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2999|n}}''</small>|EOM=[[Éomer]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2991|n}} - {{FoA|63}}''</small>|EOW=[[Éowyn]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2995|n}}''</small>|FAR=[[Faramir]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2983|n}} - {{FoA|82}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | ELF | | | | | | ELB | | |ELF=[[Elfwine]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>|ELB=[[Elboron]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn one of Tolkien's early drafts, Théoden also had a daughter by the name of [[Idis]], but she was eventually removed when her character was eclipsed by that of Éowyn.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n<center><gallery>\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Théoden.JPG|<center><small>[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]</center></small>\nFile:The Return of the King (1980 film) - Théoden.png|<center><small>[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]</center></small>\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Théoden.jpeg|<center><small>[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]</center></small>\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Théoden.jpg|<center><small>''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan]]''</center></small>\n</gallery></center>\n\n'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:[[Valentine Dyall]] voiced the part of Théoden.\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:The voice of Théoden was provided by [[Philip Stone]].\n\n'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''\n:[[Erik Bauersfeld]] provided the voice of Théoden.\n\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:Théoden is voiced by [[Don Messick]], though he speaks very little.

She was renowned for slaying the [[Witch-king of Angmar]]. She was the daughter of [[Théodwyn]], Théoden's sister, and [[Éomund]] of [[Eastfold]]; her brother was [[Éomer]]. Following the end of the [[War of the Ring]], she and [[Faramir]] were married, and she bore one son, [[Elboron]].<ref name=\"Mark\">{{App|Mark}}</ref>\n\nShe was also known as the Lady of Rohan, Lady of the Shield-arm, the White Lady of Rohan,<ref group=\"note\">Éowyn was known as \"Lady of Rohan\" in Rohan, but as \"White Lady of Rohan\" in Ithilien (due to her pale complexion).</ref> and Lady of [[Ithilien]].\n\n==History==\n{{Quote|What do you fear, lady?\"<br>\"A cage.

Éowyn grew to be tall and slender, with a grace and pride that came from her mother.<ref name=\"Mark\"/>\n\nPrior to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Éowyn was left to care for [[Meduseld]] when Théoden and Éomer led the remaining [[Rohirrim]] to the west. King Théoden named her ruler of Rohan in his and Éomer's absence when [[Háma]] recommended that one of \"The House of Eorl\" should rule. At first, Théoden only thought of the men of his house, of which he and Éomer were the last, but Háma reminded the King of Éowyn, who \"is fearless,\" and that \"all love her.\"<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref>\n\nÉowyn revealed her temperament when [[Aragorn]] was to ride into the mountains and take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Unable to dissuade him, she desired to accompany him, declaring herself \"weary of skulking in the hills,\" with a \"wish to face peril and battle.\" However, Aragorn reminded her of her charge to govern the people until the king's return and left without her.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Matt Stewart - Dernhelm.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[:Category:Images by Matt Stewart|Matt Stewart]] - ''Dernhelm'']]\nLater, when the forces of Rohan were mustered to go to Gondor, Éowyn disguised herself as a man, and under the alias of '''[[Dernhelm]]''', travelled with the Riders of Rohan, carrying with her [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], who was also ordered to remain behind.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], she fought by King Théoden, and when he was struck down by the Witch-king of Angmar, she took it upon herself to defend the King of Rohan. Confronting the Witch-king, who boasted that \"no living man may hinder me\", she removed her helmet, revealing her long golden hair and declaring:\n\n<blockquote>''\"No living man am I! You look upon a woman.\"''</blockquote>\n\nThough he was filled with doubt at her unveiling, the Witch-king fought her, and broke her shield and arm with his mace. Yet before he could strike her down, Merry, who had not been heeded by the Witch-king, struck him behind the knee with a [[Daggers of Westernesse|Barrow-blade]], crippling the wraith, and giving Éowyn the chance to thrust her sword between the crown and mantle, which shattered the blade. Thus Éowyn slew the Witch-king with Merry's aid, and fell upon her fallen foe, seemingly dead.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n\nShe was granted the title \"Lady of the Shield-arm\" after the battle in recognition of her triumph, as her shield-arm had been broken in the fight.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n\nShortly afterwards, Éomer found Éowyn beside Théoden, and, believing that both his sister and the King were dead, was filled with grief and fury. Taking the kingship of Rohan, he ordered that Théoden and Éowyn be taken to the Citadel. Éowyn was borne away alongside Théoden in honour, as she had fallen into a death-like sleep from the [[Black Breath]], and was presumed dead. However, [[Imrahil|Prince Imrahil]] recognised then that she yet lived, and instead ordered that she be taken to the [[Houses of Healing]], where she would receive help.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - The Healing of Eowyn.jpg|thumb|200px|left|\"The Healing of Éowyn\" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]\nÉowyn was severely injured, and because of the Black Breath of the Nazgûl, she faced certain death; however, she was treated soon after by Aragorn during his brief sojourn into [[Minas Tirith]].

Tolkien eventually discarded Idis as Éowyn overshadowed her, and planned to have Éowyn wed Aragorn when he became the King of Gondor. However, Tolkien cut out the love story, deciding to make Éowyn \"''the twin-sister of Eomund, a stern amazon woman''\", and possibly dying to save or avenge Théoden.<ref name=King>{{TI|King}}, pp. 447-448</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\nJust as MacDuff disconcerted [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Macbeth Macbeth] by revealing he was not \"of woman born\", Lady Éowyn found the loophole in the 1,000-year-old prophecy by [[Glorfindel]], fulfilling that the Witch-king would not be slain by a man. However, the Witch-king actually recited the prophecy incorrectly: he said that \"no living man may hinder me,\" though the prophecy actually said that \"not by the hand of ''man'' will he fall.\"<ref name=\"Gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Glorfindel's prophecy, unlike his own version, implies that the Witch-king will not fall to a man. In Tolkien's writing, man and woman applies simply to the gender of any Middle-earth race. Only when he capitalised Man did it denote the race of Men. The Witch-king may not have realised that the prophecy meant only a male, thus, his moment of doubt and hesitation when he faced Éowyn.<ref name=\"Battle\"/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Éowyn in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Éowyn.jpg|[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Return of the King (1980 film) - Éowyn.jpg|[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Éowyn.jpg|[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Éowyn.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1955-6: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:[[Olive Gregg]] provides the voice of Éowyn.\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:Éowyn is briefly seen, but has no lines.\n\n'''1979: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|The Mind's Eye's The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''\n:Éowyn is portrayed by [[Karen Hurley]].\n\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:Éowyn is voiced by actress [[Nellie Bellflower]].

After King Théoden departs with his host, the player stays behind and helps Éowyn with various preparations before moving the citizens to [[Dunharrow]]. As Dernhelm, she travels to Minas Tirith with permission of [[Elfhelm]], who keeps her secret and gives her the sword of her late cousin [[Théodred]], taken from the [[Fords of Isen]]. It is the very sword that Eowyn uses to slay the [[Witch-King]] of [[Angmar]], though it breaks in doing the deed. After healing from her wounds, she attends the coronation of King Elessar, but departs for Edoras prior to Aragorn and Arwen's wedding.\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Images of Éowyn|Images of Éowyn]]\n\n==External links==\n\n*\"[http://www.norsemyth.org/2013/02/tolkiens-heathen-feminist-part-one.html Tolkien's Heathen Feminist]\" by Karl E.H.

He was the son of [[Théodwyn]], sister of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]], and [[Éomund]], a Chief Marshal of the [[Riddermark]]. After he and his sister [[Éowyn]] were orphaned, Théoden adopted them as his own children.<ref name=\"Appendix A\">{{App|Mark}}</ref>   \n\n==History==\n===Youth===\n[[File:Anna Lee - Young Éomer and Éowyn.jpg|thumb|left|Anna Lee - ''Young Éomer and Éowyn'']]\nÉomer was born in {{TA|2991}} as son of [[Éomund]] and [[Théodwyn]]. When he was eleven years old, his father was slain by [[Orcs|Orc]] raiders in the [[Emyn Muil]]. His mother fell ill and died soon after. His uncle [[Théoden]] adopted him and his sister [[Éowyn]] as his own children and they went to live at [[Meduseld]].\n\nÉomer grew strong and tall and became a valiant and skilled warrior and rider. Théoden made him [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark]] and he was in command of the [[East-mark]] like his father. He had his home at [[Aldburg]] in the [[Folde]], one of the oldest towns of Rohan. With his [[Éored]] he defended Rohan mainly against Orcs from [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"Appendix A\" />\n\n===Struggle against Saruman===\n[[File:John Howe - Eomer 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|\"Éomer\" by [[John Howe]]]]\nBut Rohan's enemies were not only at the borders but also within. [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]], the King's advisor, was secretly a spy of the wizard [[Saruman]], who dwelled at [[Isengard]] and had become a servant of [[Sauron]]. Gríma, in secret, worked to weaken Théoden and his kingdom and Théoden fell deeply under his influence. Éomer fell into the King's disfavor, but Gríma did not manage to destroy Éomer's loyalty to Théoden; nor to his cousin, Prince [[Théodred]], whom Éomer regarded as his brother.\n\nIn the summer of {{TA|3018|n}} [[Boromir]], son of [[Denethor|Denethor II]], crossed Rohan on his way to [[Rivendell]]. Éomer learned from him about the dream of [[Isildur's Bane]]. Soon after September, evil Men, Orcs and Wargs in Saruman's service began to fight openly against the Rohirrim. Saruman claimed lordship over Rohan and blocked the [[Gap of Rohan]].\n\nThe chief obstacles to an easy conquest of Rohan by Saruman were Théodred and Éomer. So came the first great battle in the conflict, the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], on [[25 February]] {{TA|3019|n}}. After untiring assaults on Théodred's position, the Prince was finally killed, leaving Éomer as the only obstacle. \n\nThe [[26 February|day after]] the battle, Èomer gained knowledge of a troop of Orcs entering Rohan from [[Emyn Muil]] to the east. Unbeknownst to Éomer, they were the same Orcs that had taken [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] captive. Suspecting an alliance between Saruman and Sauron, he wanted to hunt them down. Under the strong influence of Gríma, Théoden forbade Éomer to pursue the Orcs because Edoras would be left unguarded. But Éomer neglected the order since he already suspected Gríma's treachery, and [[27 February|at around midnight]] he set out from [[Eastfold]] with his [[Éored]]. At the end of [[28 February|the next day]] they caught sight of the Orcs at the border of [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref name=\"Appendix B\">{{App|Great}}</ref> They surrounded them and remained watchful throughout the night. With several small attacks they weakened the troop until another Orc band from Isengard arrived. The Rohirrim defeated them and surrounded the first troop even closer.\n\nWith the first light of the new day the Rohirrim proceeded to attack. They killed all the Orcs and Éomer himself slew their leader [[Uglúk]]. The [[hobbits]] meanwhile were able to flee into Fangorn Forest. \nFifteen men and 12 horses did not survive the assault. They were buried in a mound encircled with fifteen spears.<ref name=\"Uruk-hai\">{{TT|Uruk}}</ref>\n[[File:Cor Blok - Meeting of Éomer with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"Meeting of Éomer with [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]]\" by [[Cor Blok]]]]\nOn the way back to Edoras, the Rohirrim met [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], and [[Legolas]]. Éomer demanded their names and business. Fighting almost broke almost out between them, but Aragorn prevented this. He then told Éomer his true name and showed him his sword, [[Andúril]]. Éomer now listened to the story of their journey, and learned about the losses of [[Gandalf]] and [[Boromir]]. When Aragorn revealed that they had tracked the band of Orcs all the way from the [[Emyn Muil]] in the hope of rescuing the hobbits, Éomer was astonished and gave Aragorn the name \"Wingfoot\", recognizing the difficulty of crossing so much terrain in so little time. He revealed that his men had destroyed the band of Orcs, and that it was fruitless to go searching for his friends. He instead urged Aragorn to return with him to Edoras to help the people of Rohan in their need, but Aragorn refused and insisted that he be able to continue his search for the hobbits. Although he was counteracting the law of Rohan by letting Aragorn go free, Éomer decided to trust him and he even lent him and his companions two horses, [[Hasufel]] and [[Arod]], to help them in their search, but he asked them to prove his trust by bringing them back to Edoras when their search was over.<ref name=\"Riders\">{{TT|Riders}}</ref>\n\nUpon his return to Edoras, Éomer threatened Gríma, but Gríma arrested him and accused him of breaking the law because he had pursued the Orcs and had allowed strangers to roam freely without Théoden's permission. \n[[File:John Howe - Helm's Deep.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[John Howe]] - ''Helms Deep'']]\nÉomer was released after Gandalf healed Théoden from the influence of Gríma. He was delighted to see that his king was recovering quickly from his weakness. Now Gríma's treachery was revealed, but due to Gandalf's intervening he was not killed, but rather expelled from the [[Meduseld|Golden Hall]]. Théoden, now realizing the situation, decided to lead the Rohirrim into battle against Saruman instantly. The [[Three Hunters]] and Gandalf accompanied them when they left Edoras the same day.<ref name=\"King\">{{TT|King}}</ref>\n\nThe following day they met the scout [[Ceorl]] who had been sent out by [[Erkenbrand]] to warn Éomer. He was surprised to come across King Théoden's army riding north and brought news that Saruman had let loose his forces and that the Rohirrim had been forced to retreat across the Isen with great losses. These tidings caused Théoden to reconsider his strategy. After consulting with Gandalf he decided to ride to join Erkenbrand at [[Helm's Deep]] while the wizard left them, saying that he would meet them there.\n\nThey arrived at Helm's Deep on the night of [[3 March]] and Éomer oversaw the preparations for the great battle. In the middle of the night, the siege began, and when battering rams attacked the gates, Éomer and Aragorn led a sortie through a passage on the side of the Hornburg that drove the enemies threatening the doors away. In the course of this Gimli saved Éomer's life when he killed two Orcs who had ambushed Éomer. The battle continued throughout the night and ever more attackers scaled the walls with large ladders. Aragorn and Éomer had to repeatedly move the defenders, who were getting weary, to repel the Orcs. With the help of a device of Saruman's the Orcs caused an explosion under the wall that made a wide hole in it. From then on the attackers could not be stopped and the defenders were separated. Éomer and Gimli retreated to the [[Glittering Caves]] whereas Aragorn and Legolas defended the Hornburg.\n\nThe battle seemed lost when at dawn Gandalf returned with Erkenbrand and 1000 riders from the Westfold. Together they drove the enemies out of the deep and into a forest of [[Huorns]] that had arrived during the night and from which no Orcs returned.<ref name=\"Deep\">{{TT|Deep}}</ref>\nAfter the end of the battle Éomer accompanied his king to Isengard.<ref name=\"Road\">{{HM|TT}}, \"[[The Road to Isengard]]\"</ref> There they met Saruman who tried to enthral Théoden with his magic voice, but both Éomer and Théoden saw through him and his dark designs. Théoden said that Rohan would have no peace until Saruman and his works had perished. Gandalf then broke Saruman's staff and cast him from the Order of [[Wizards]] and the [[White Council]].<ref name=\"Voice\">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>\n\n===The Battle of the Pelennor Fields===\nOn [[5 March]] the company set out to Helm's Deep. While they rested in the night Pippin took the ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' [[Orthanc-stone|of Orthanc]] from the sleeping Gandalf, looked in it, and was confronted by Sauron. Knowing the peril Pippin was in, Gandalf said farewell to the others and departed with Pippin towards [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\"Palantir\">{{TT|Palantir}}</ref> The Three Hunters and the Rohirrim continued their journey towards Helm's Deep where they arrived on [[6 March]]. Now Aragorn looked into the palantír and revealed himself to Sauron. Because of what he glimpsed in the ''palantír'', he left the Rohirrim, and took the [[Paths of the Dead]] with the [[Grey Company]]. Éomer was afraid of never seeing him again, but Aragorn predicted that they would \"meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor should stand between.\" before setting out.<ref name=\"Passing\">{{RK|Company}}</ref>\n\nÉomer accompanied his king to the muster of [[Dunharrow]] where he met his sister Éowyn again. Then the [[Red Arrow]] of [[Gondor]], which requested Rohan's aid, was brought by a messenger and the Rohhirim set out in great haste to Minas Tirith.<ref name=\"Muster\">{{RK|Muster}}</ref> They used narrow mountain paths and on [[13 March]] reached Drúadan Forest where they met [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]], the chief of the Drúedain. He agreed to lead the Rohirrim by a secret road past the Orc hosts that laid siege to Minas Tirith.\n[[File:Per Sjögren - The Battle of the Pelennor Fields.jpg|thumb|Per Sjögren - ''The Battle of the Pelennor Fields'']]\nThe Rohirrim arrived on the battleground of the [[Pelennor Fields]] at dawn on [[15 March]]. Éomer led the first Éored that should follow the king's banner in the centre.<ref name=\"Ride\">{{RK|Ride}}</ref> The Rohirrim were strong and filled with wrath and many enemies were slain. The Rohirrim went hither and thither at their will and so Éomer was only brought to Théoden when the king was already mortally wounded. Before his death Théoden hailed Éomer as King of the Mark and Éomer and those who stood by wept. When Éomer recognized Éowyn lying nearby, a cold fury rose in him and without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of the City he led his men across the field, slaying all enemies in their path. As they charged he shouted out \"Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world's ending!\".\n\nBut soon fortune turned against Éomer and he and his men were encircled. Just in time came the aid of the horsemen of Gondor, among them [[Hirluin|Hirluin of the Green Hills]] and [[Imrahil]] prince of [[Dol Amroth]]. But ever more enemies came from [[Osgiliath]], and when the black ships of the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] came up the [[Anduin]], the battle seemed lost. Éomer rallied the Rohirrim for a last fight against the Corsairs when he realized the standard of Aragorn unfurling on the first ship. \n[[File:Abe Papakhian - Eomer and Aragorn (colour).jpg|left|thumb|Abe Papakhian - ''Éomer and Aragorn'']]\nThe enemies fled when they saw that their own ships were filled with foes and so Éomer met Aragorn in the midst of the battlefield as Aragorn had predicted.<ref name=\"Pelennor\">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\nThe battle ended in victory and Éomer learned that Éowyn was not dead, but lay gravely ill in the [[Houses of Healing]]. He also learned that the contact with the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] was not the only reason for her sickness but that also her despair had worsened it. Aragorn managed to heal Éowyn and she awoke at her brother's call. Meriadoc Brandybuck was also healed and Éomer made him a Knight of the Riddermark in return for his aid for Éowyn and Théoden.<ref name=\"Healing\">{{RK|Houses}}</ref>\n\nThe next day, Éomer took part in the debate of the Captains of the West. There Gandalf told that their hope now lay with [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]], who had gone to [[Mordor]] to destroy [[the One Ring]] wrought by Sauron. Gandalf counselled that they should ride to the [[Black Gate]] in order to force Sauron to empty his land and take the Dark Lord's attention away from his search for the Ring, giving the Ring-bearers their only chance. Aragorn agreed and Éomer followed his friend in return for his aid in their time of need.<ref name=\"Debate\">{{RK|Debate}}</ref>\n\nOn [[18 March]] the [[Army of the West|Host of the West]], Gandalf, the Three Hunters, and Éomer among them, set out towards the Black Gate. They [[Battle of the Morannon|fought]] there on [[25 March]] and withstood the forces of the enemy until the Ring was destroyed and Sauron and his servants and works perished.<ref name=\"Gate\">{{RK|Gate}}</ref>\n\n===King of the Mark===\nAfter the great victory, Aragorn set up his camp on the [[Field of Cormallen]] in [[North Ithilien]] and Éomer took part in the celebrations there.<ref name=\"Cormallen\">{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> \nTogether with the other Captains of the West he returned to Minas Tirith and attended the coronation of Aragorn on [[1 May]]. A week later he renewed the [[Oath of Eorl]] for Aragorn and both swore everlasting friendship between Rohan and Gondor.<ref name=\"Steward\">{{RK|Steward}}</ref> On [[8 May]] he, with his sister, set out to Rohan, for there was much to organize and to set in order.<ref name=\"chief\">{{app|Chief}}</ref> \n\nÉomer returned to Minas Tirith on [[18 July]] and set out the [[19 July|next day]], bringing Théoden's body back to Edoras. On [[10 August]] the funeral of Théoden took place<ref name=\"chief\" /> and Éomer announced the betrothal of Éowyn to [[Faramir]], the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] and [[Prince of Ithilien]]. When the feast was over, Éomer and Éowyn gave Merry the name [[Holdwine]], \"loyal friend,\" of the Mark, and the ancient [[Horn of the Mark]], an heirloom of the [[House of Eorl]].<ref name=\"Partings\" />\n\nKing Éomer discarded the old offices of [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark|Second]] and [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark|Third Marshals of Rohan]] and instead created the positions of [[Marshal of the West-mark]] (the first of whom was [[Erkenbrand]]) and [[Marshal of the East-mark]] (the first of whom was [[Elfhelm]]).<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, p. 470</ref>\n\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Sons of Rohan.jpg|thumb|[[Jenny Dolfen]] - ''Sons of Rohan'']]\nBut though Sauron had perished, the [[King of the West]] had many enemies to destroy before the [[White Tree]] could grow in peace. So Éomer often fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]] and went with King Elessar far into the [[East]] and [[South (disambiguation)|South]] of [[Middle-earth]]. He was known as '''Éomer Éadig''', or \"the Blessed\", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again. In {{TA|3021}} he wedded Princess [[Lothíriel]], daughter of Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]], whom he had met during his stay in Gondor, and she bore him a son [[Elfwine]] the Fair.<ref name=\"Appendix A\" /><ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line''</ref>\n\nHe kept his friendship with his knight Merry Brandybuck and when he became [[Master of Buckland]] in {{FoA|11}}, the King sent him great gifts, as did his sister from [[Ithilien]].<ref name=\"later\">{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FoA|63}} Éomer, presumably feeling death coming near him, asked Master [[Holdwine]] to visit him one last time. Both Merry and his friend Pippin came to Rohan and stayed with him until the autumn of that year, when King Éomer died.<ref name=\"later\" />\n\nKing Éomer had reigned for 65 years, longer than any other King of Rohan save [[Aldor the Old]]. His son Elfwine the Fair became King of Rohan.\n\n==Personality==\nHe was tall, strong, and possessed of great passion and also was considered a valiant and splendid warrior and a discerning and decent man. Éomer was \"of like height with [[Aragorn]]\" (which was probably 6&nbsp;ft, 6in.<ref name=\"RC229\">{{HM|RC}}, page 229</ref>), due to his grandmother [[Morwen Steelsheen]], who was of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent.<ref name=\"RC367\">{{HM|RC}}, page 367</ref>\n\n==Weapon==\nÉomer's sword was called [[Gúthwinë]],<ref name=\"Deep\" /> which is [[Old English]] for \"battle-friend\".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 85</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nHis name is likely derived from the Anglo-Saxon words ''eoh'' (\"war-horse\"), and ''mǣre'', (\"grand, excellent, famous\").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 367</ref> Éo- sounds like \"eh-ah\" with the \"ah\" just barely pronounced.<ref>{{App|E1iv}}, p. 1117</ref>\n\nHe adopted the epithet ''Éadig'' during his kingship, which is an [[Old English]] word meaning \"happy, wealthy\" and usually translated as \"blessed\", used for saints in medieval literature.<ref>http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/old_to_new_english_e.htm</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | THE |y| MOR | | | | | | | | |THE=[[Thengel]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2905|n}} - {{TA|2980|n}}''</small>|MOR=[[Morwen Steelsheen]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2922|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | ELF |y| THE | | DAU | | THW |y| EOM | | |ELF=[[Elfhild]]<br/><small>''d. {{TA|2978|n}}''</small>|THE=[[Théoden]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2948|n}} - {{TA|3019|n}}''†</small>|DAU=''three daughters''<br/><small>''unknown''</small>|THW=[[Théodwyn]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2963|n}} - {{TA|3002|n}}''</small>|EOM=[[Éomund]]<br/><small>''d. {{TA|3002|n}}''†</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | THE | | LOT |y| EOM | | EOW |y| FAR |THE=[[Théodred]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2978|n}} - {{TA|3019|n}}''†</small>|LOT=[[Lothíriel]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2999|n}}''</small>|EOM='''ÉOMER'''<br/><small>''{{TA|2991|n}} - {{FoA|63}}''</small>|EOW=[[Éowyn]]<br/><small>''b. {{TA|2995|n}}''</small>|FAR=[[Faramir]]<br/><small>''{{TA|2983|n}} - {{FoA|82}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | ELF | | | | | | ELB | | |ELF=[[Elfwine]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>|ELB=[[Elboron]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Inspiration==\n''Eomer'' is an [[Old English]] name appearing in ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''.

I return!|Thorin in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', \"[[A Warm Welcome]]\"}}</center>\n\n'''Thorin II''', also known as '''Thorin Oakenshield''', was the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]] from {{TA|2850}} until his death in {{TA|2941}}, being the son of [[Thráin|Thráin II]], grandson of [[Thrór]] and older brother to [[Frerin]] and [[Dís]]. Thorin led [[Durin's Folk]] of the [[Blue Mountains]] during their time in exile. In {{TA|2941}} he led the [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] accompanied by twelve [[Dwarves]], [[Bilbo Baggins]], and [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]]; he briefly became [[King under the Mountain]] until he perished following the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{App|A3}}; {{UT|9}}; {{H|10}}; {{App|B2}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Youth and exile===\nThorin was born in {{TA|2746}}, presumably in the Lonely Mountain where his grandfather, [[Thrór]], was King under the Mountain. Thorin was still a youngster (aged c. 24), by Dwarves' reckoning, when the dragon [[Smaug]] descended upon the mountain of Erebor in flames. Smaug left the mannish town of [[Dale]] in ruins and killed many dwarves who were inside the mountain. Thrór and Thráin (Thorin's father) escaped using a secret [[Back Door]]. Meanwhile Thorin was one of the few Dwarves who were not inside the mountain at the time. Thus the surviving [[Dwarves of Erebor]] were driven into exile and Thrór, Thráin, and Thorin fled south and ended up to [[Dunland]].<ref name=\"AppA3\" /><ref name=\"H1\" />\n\n===War of the Dwarves and Orcs===\nDisillusioned, Thorin's grandfather Thrór wandered to the [[Great Gates|Eastern gate]] of [[Moria]], the old mansion of the [[Longbeards]], now infested by [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orcs]]. He entered it and ended up murdered and desecrated by the Orc [[Azog]]. These news were brought by his companion [[Nár]] to Thráin, thus the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] began.<ref name=\"AppA3\" />\n[[File:Mikel Janin - Battle of Azanulbizar.jpeg|left|thumb|''Battle of Azanulbizar'' by [[:Category:Images by Mikel Janin|Mikel Janin]]]]\nThe war was fought long and hard between the two races, ultimately ending in a pyrrhic Dwarven victory at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in {{TA|2799}}. Both Thráin and Thorin were wounded during this battle and [[Frerin]] (Thorin's brother) was killed. When his shield broke, he cut a bough from an oak tree to block the blows of his foes.<ref>{{App|A3}}, note 46.</ref> Despite victory no Dwarf dared to re-enter [[Moria]] out of fear of [[Durin's Bane]].<ref name=\"App|A3\">{{App|A3}}; {{App|B2}}</ref>\n\nIn memory of this, Thorin swore to always bear a plain shield of oak with no device until he should be hailed king,<ref>{{PM|Aiv}}</ref> and thus he earned the epithet '''Oakenshield'''.\n\n===Return into exile===\n[[File:Charles Burggraf - We will get it back.jpg|thumb|right|left|''\"We will get it back\"'' by [[:Category:Images by Charles Burggraf|Charles Burggraf]]]]\nThráin, Thorin, and the other survivors of [[Durin's Folk]] left Azanulbizar and returned to [[Dunland]]. However they soon began to wander [[Eriador]] before settling at last in the [[Blue Mountains]]. Here they prospered in their own fashion, forging iron objects and increasing their numbers (albeit, due to a scarceness of [[Dwarf-women]], very slowly, and by wandering Longbeards who heard of his dwelling). Nonetheless they all still longed to return to the Lonely Mountain.<ref name=\"AppA3\" />\n\nBy this time Thráin was in possession of [[Ring of Thrór|the last]] of the [[Seven Rings]] of power. It is possible that as [[Sauron]]'s power grew so too did the ring's influence over Thráin. His burning desire for gold and to return to the Lonely Mountain became too great and in {{TA|2841}} he set out to return. Thorin, then aged ninety-five, was never to see his father again, as Sauron captured and imprisoned Thráin in [[Dol Guldur]]. Thus it was that around Thráin 's disappearance and death ({{TA|2850}}) Thorin became the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]. Thorin and his people were content living in the [[Blue Mountains]] and [[Eriador]] but as the years waned Thorin's desire to return to Erebor grew.<ref name=\"App|A3\" />\n\n===Quest for Erebor===\n<!--Insert basic storyline of The Hobbit-->\n====A new hope====\n{{quote|Listen to me, Thorin Oakenshield! [...] If this hobbit goes with you, you will succeed. If not, you will fail. A foresight is on me, and I am warning you.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name=\"UT9\">{{UT|9}}</ref>}}\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf and Thorin.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf and Thorin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThe fortunes of the House of Durin changed when Thorin met [[Gandalf]] by chance in {{TA|2941}}.<ref group=\"note\">Different accounts dispute the exact location of this first meeting. One source states that it occurred at an Inn in [[Bree]]. Whilst another states that Thorin started talking to Gandalf when he overtook him on the road.</ref> They then proceeded to go to [[Thorin's Halls]]. There they discussed their tales and Gandalf formulated a plan. Gandalf knew that Sauron could have potentially used Smaug with devastating effect. Therefore both he and Thorin had a shared interest in removing Smaug. Gandalf wanted Thorin and a company of dwarves to travel to the Lonely Mountain taking [[Bilbo Baggins]] with them. Gandalf's instinct was that the [[Quest of Erebor]] would only be successful if Bilbo accompanied them.\n\nTherefore Gandalf invited Thorin and other Dwarves to [[Hobbiton]] of [[the Shire]], instructing them to look for a [[Smials|smial]] whose door was marked with the sign of the thief (as the dwarves had gotten it into their head that Bilbo was a thief). Thus Thorin found himself in [[Bag End]], where they perused the hobbit's hospitality. However, Thorin and the dwarves were not convinced; it was not until Gandalf revealed [[Thrór's Map]] and key that Thorin was convinced that the quest would be profitable to him. Even after the \"[[An Unexpected Party|Unexpected Party]]\" Gandalf only persuaded Thorin to take Bilbo on the morning that they set off.<ref>{{App|A3}}; {{UT|9}}</ref>\n\nThus it was that in {{TA|2941}} Thorin set off for the Lonely Mountain with Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Dori]], [[Nori]], [[Ori]], [[Óin]], [[Glóin]], [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], and [[Bombur]]. A short time into the journey the adventurers found a Troll's cave. Here they found a hoard of treasure which included blades made in the ancient city of [[Gondolin]]. Bilbo found a knife that he named [[Sting]], Gandalf acquired [[Glamdring]] and meanwhile Thorin found [[Orcrist]].<ref name=\"H2\"></ref> Whilst [[Thorin and Company]] were in [[Rivendell]] [[Elrond]] read the inscriptions on the blades and informed them of their sword's histories. He also read the [[moon-letters]] on Thrór's map; it read \"''stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks [...] and the setting sun with the last light of [[Durin's Day]] will shine upon the keyhole.''\"<ref>{{H|3}}</ref>\n\n====Return of the King under the Mountain====\n[[File:David T. Wenzel - Thorin in Esgaroth.jpg|thumb|left|''Thorin in Esgaroth'' by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]\nUpon reaching [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]], the closest settlement to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin was greeted warmly and the men of Lake-town hailed the return of the [[King under the Mountain]].<ref name=\"H10\">{{H|10}}</ref> They soon reached the Lonely Mountain itself and \"''with the last light of Durin's Day''\" they found the secret side-door, using the key to open it.<ref>{{H|11}}</ref> Thorin sent Bilbo in to carry out his duty as their 'esteemed burglar'. This enraged Smaug who sought to destroy the burglar and take out his vengeance on the [[Lake-men]].<ref>{{H|12}}</ref> The dragon was slain by [[Bard]] who pierced an un-armoured spot on the dragon's underside <ref>{{H|14}}</ref> with a [[Black Arrow]].\n\nUpon hearing the news of the death of Smaug, Thorin fortified the main entrance to the mountain. Hosts of [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] and Lake-men approached the mountain led by the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] and Bard respectively. Thorin refused to consider Bard's claim to a share in the treasure until the Elven-host had withdrawn. Refusing to send away the Elves, Bard pronounced the mountain under siege until Thorin would give them their part of the treasure. Then Thorin sent for his cousin, [[Dáin Ironfoot]], who brought more than five-hundred Dwarves from the [[Iron Hills]].<ref>{{H|15}}; {{H|16}}</ref> Bilbo sought to bring an end to the dispute; to this end he secretly gave the [[Arkenstone]] to Bard and the Elvenking to use in making a deal with Thorin. When Thorin heard about Bilbo's actions he was furious and cast him out of the company.<ref>{{H|17}}</ref>\n\n====Death====\n[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Death of Thorin Oakenshield.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Thorin Oakenshield'' by [[Darrell Sweet]]]]\nHowever, all disputes were cast aside when the army of [[Bolg]], Azog's son, suddenly attacked. Thus the three armies of [[Elves]], [[Men]], and [[Dwarves]] united against the two armies of [[Orcs|Goblins]] and [[Wargs]]: the [[Battle of Five Armies]] had begun. As the battle drew on, Thorin leapt from the front gate and rallied all Elves, Men, and Dwarves to him. The armies of the [[free peoples]] of [[Middle-earth]] emerged triumphant. Nonetheless [[Kíli]] and [[Fíli]] were killed and Thorin was gravely wounded. On his deathbed Thorin apologised to Bilbo for his angry words and deeds. He commended his good character, courage and friendship, saying that ''\"if more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\"'' With that, he died. He was laid to rest deep within the Lonely Mountain. [[Bard]] of [[Dale]] placed the Arkenstone upon Thorin's chest, whilst the Elvenking laid Orcrist upon Thorin's tomb.<ref>{{H|17}}; {{H|18}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Appearance===\n{{quote|It was Thorin, but you could only have told it by his golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky-blue hood with its tarnished silver tassel.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', \"[[Barrels Out of Bond]]\"}}\n\nThorin had a white beard<ref name=\"History\">{{HH|7iv}}</ref> and wore a sky-blue hood with a long silver tassel. Around his neck he wore a golden chain, upon which he attached his grandfather's key.<ref name=\"H1\" /> He wore a belt of gold and jewels,<ref name=\"History\" /> and his stockings were yellow. He was also said to be quite tall for a dwarf, though his height was otherwise negligible compared to other races.<ref name=\"H2\"></ref>\n\n===Personality===\n{{quote|Thorin did not live to enjoy his triumph or his treasure. Pride and greed overcame him in spite of my warning.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name=\"UT9\"/>}}\n\nThorin was capable of being stubborn, proud, and greedy. According to Gandalf he was, from the beginning, contemptuous about the notion that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] should go with him on his long-desired adventure to the Lonely Mountain; he thought that Gandalf was trying to mock him and make him look foolish. Indeed, Thorin found it difficult to accept the advice of Gandalf at all, believing that he should have been drawing plans for war and battle rather than planning to use a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] as a burglar. He gradually came to respect the Hobbit's value to his quest as Bilbo again and again proved his stealth and courage. Thorin's most coveted prize was the [[Arkenstone]], something which Bilbo believed was not only the heart of the mountain but the heart of Thorin also.<ref>{{UT|9}}; {{H|17}}; {{H|18}}</ref>\n\nAnother one of his distinctive characteristics was that on important occasions he had the habit of going on \"without telling any one there anything that was not known already\".<ref name=\"H1\" /> Once he referred to Fíli and Kíli as \"sons of my father's daughter\" rather than \"nephews\" or \"sister-sons\", for instance.<ref name=\"H10\" />\n\n===Weapons===\nThorin was a formidable swordsman, archer, and skilled military leader, capable of rallying Men, Elves and Dwarves to his side in the Battle of the Five Armies. He was the owner of the elven blade known as Orcrist, The Goblin Cleaver, a legendary sword from Gondolin that was said to have slain hundreds of goblins. When orcs or goblins were nearby, it glowed blue. He used this blade throughout the entire Quest of Erebor, but was taken from him during his capture in Mirkwood. It was then later laid on his tomb, after his death to warn Erebor of any oncoming dark forces that would dare try to take over the Mountain \n\n==Etymology==\nThorin's name is one from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means \"Bold\".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, \"Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion\", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>\n\nThe epithet \"[[Oakenshield]]\" also comes from the ''Dvergatal''. ''Eikinskjaldi'' means \"Oakenshield\", and it has long been considered the name of a Dwarf. However, because the name appears twice, both in Dúrinn's and Dválinn's line, it has also been suggested that it simply means \"with an oaken shield\".<ref>P.H.

Thorin, however, does have streaks of gray in his black hair.\n\n:In the prologue which flashes back to the [[Sack of Erebor]], Thorin is shown to be a natural leader, and is distressed when [[Thranduil]] and his army do not come to the Dwarves' aid.

Celeborn ruled the fief of [[Harlindon]], which was composed mostly of [[Sindar]], under [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Gil-galad]].<ref>{{PM|X}}</ref>\n\n[[Galadriel]] and Celeborn crossed into [[Eriador]] with many [[Noldor]], [[Sindar]], and [[Green-elves]] in their following. For a while, they dwelt in the country about [[Lake Nenuial]], ruling the Eldar in Eriador, including the wandering companies of the native Nandor.

Celeborn and Galadriel offered advice and boats for the [[Anduin]], sending them on their way. After the [[Galadhrim]] repelled the forces of [[Dol Guldur]] three times, Celeborn led the forces of the Galadhrim across the [[Anduin]] and [[Fall of Dol Guldur|took the fortress]].

Aragorn suggests Arwen might still take passage on a ship from Mithlond into the West, but by this time Arwen had long forfeited the right to live in the [[Undying Lands]]. The words \"and some say [Círdan] dwells there still, until the Last Ship sets sail into the West\" derive from the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], and not from the ''original'' [[Red Book]], which has not been preserved, but from a copy of it, the first of them being the [[Thain's Book]], copied in {{FoA|171}}. Thus, the speculation about [[Círdan]] still dwelling in [[Mithlond]] cannot be exactly dated to a period before [[Aragorn II Elessar|Elessar]]'s and [[Arwen]]'s death. This means that the Last Ship would have sailed at some unknown date after {{FoA|171}}.</ref> he sought the [[Grey Havens]] and sailed west aboard [[Last Ship]] with his mighty kinsman [[Cirdan the Shipwright]], but when he did so, he took with him the last memory of the [[Elder Days]] in Middle-earth.<ref name=prologue/>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Celeborn.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Celeborn'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, consisting of ''[[celeb]]'' (\"silver\") + a derivative of ''[[ornā]]'' (\"tall\"). ''Teleporno'', his original [[Telerin]] name, has an identical meaning. The name Teleporno was \"Sindarized\" as ''Celeborn'': [[Telerin]] ''[[telepi|telpe]]'' (\"silver\") (Quenya ''[[telpe|tyelpe]]'') was transformed to Sindarin ''celeb''.<ref>{{UT|6e}}</ref> Teleporno's name gained an additional [[Quenya]] form, '''[[Telporno]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[telˈporno]}}).<ref>{{L|347}}</ref>\n\nHe was given the epithet \"the Wise\" by Galadriel.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}, twenty-fifth paragraph</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | ELM | | |ELM=[[Elmo]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | GLD | | |GLD=[[Galadhon]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | GAL |y| CEL | | GLT |GAL=[[Galadriel]]|CEL='''CELEBORN'''|GLT=[[Galathil]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | |CLB| | | | | | | |CLB=[[Celebrían]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===As a Sinda===\nBefore the summer of 1950 in an earlier version of the [[The Appendix on Languages|Appendix on Languages]] it was mentioned that the native language of Celeborn was ''[[Telerin|Telerian]]'', the native language of the Teleri who remained behind in the north-west of Middle-earth, of the Elves of Lórien and of the elf-kingdom in Northern Mirkwood of [[Thranduil]], and that in the household of [[Galadriel]] also ''[[Noldorin]]'' was spoken, because she was a Noldo.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, §18, p. 36 and §3 - §5, commentary §18, pp. 65-66</ref> It thus appears that Celeborn was a wood-elf in this earlier version. In a later version of the Appendix on Languages following a major revision of 1951, it is first mentioned that Celeborn was a Sinda (Grey-elf) and that most of the people of Lórien were of a woodland race.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, typescript F4</ref> The text in the final version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' only mentions that Celeborn was a kinsman of [[Thingol]].<ref>{{App|SA}}, second paragraph</ref><ref>{{App|Elves}} third paragraph mentioning that the Exiles had adopted Sindarin and that Galadriel was the noblest of all</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' does not mention the ancestry of Celeborn and if he was a Sinda or a Teler from [[Valinor]]. The text in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' also only mentions that Celeborn was a ''kinsman of Thingol'' and that Galadriel stayed in [[Doriath]], because Celeborn lived there and did not accompany her brother [[Finrod]] to [[Nargothrond]],<ref name=Return/> and that Celeborn was a ''prince of Doriath''<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> and calls him ''Celeborn of Doriath''.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref><ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> ''The Silmarillion'' leaves the ancestry of Celeborn open and there is no mention if he was a Sinda or Teler, only implying that Galadriel met Celeborn in Doriath.\n\nIn a table with the descendants of Thingol from December 1959 Thingol's younger brother [[Elmo]] has a son [[Galadhon]] who has two sons, Celeborn and [[Galathil]], and a daughter, [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]], who married King [[Dior]]. However, on the same table Nimloth also appears as the daughter of Galathil. It looks as if the second thought of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was that Nimloth was the daughter of Galathil and the niece of Celeborn.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, stage 'D', p. 257</ref> The genealogy according to this second thought was included in [[Unfinished Tales]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, last paragraph before the section Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn, p. 233</ref> According to that table, Celeborn is thus the greatnephew of Thingol and second cousin of Galadriel.\n\nIn a text written in 1965, Celeborn is born in [[Beleriand]] and he is a descendant of [[Elmo]].<ref name=elfage>{{NM|P1xviii}}</ref> In a rejected note he is the father of Amroth, and was left with his son after his (first) wife stole away and deserted them. Tolkien further noted that while remarriage seldom happened, it could occur in the time of such divided feelings as of the end of the First Age.<ref name=elfage/>{{rp|note 6}}\n\nOnly a note in [[The Road Goes Ever On]], which was published in 1967 during J.R.R. Tolkien's lifetime, strictly mentions that Celeborn was a Sinda.<ref name=RGEONotes/>\n\n===As a Teler===\nAccording to an alternate history of Celeborn and Galadriel in [[Unfinished Tales]], Celeborn was a [[Teler]] of noble rank in [[Alqualondë]],<ref name=AAm>{{MR|P2o}}, notes and corrections, §149</ref> born '''[[Teleporno]]''',<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 347, 364 (note 46)</ref> grandson of [[Olwë]], prince of [[Alqualondë]] (thus he was a kinsman of [[Thingol]] in [[Beleriand]]).<ref name=\"GC\">{{UT|Galadriel}}, eighteenth paragraph</ref> Only nine months before his death, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] still was of the opinion that Celeborn was only a kinsman of Thingol afar off, because Celeborn came from Valinor and that his orginal name was ''Telporno''.<ref>{{L|347}}, answer to question 3</ref>\n\nIn one c. [[1969]] version of the legendarium, Celeborn was the son of a [[Falmari|Telerin]] [[Elf]] called [[Gilitīro]].<ref>{{PE|23b}}, p. 143</ref>\n\n[[Galadriel|Artanis]], Olwë's granddaughter and a [[Noldor]]in princess of great beauty, often spent long visits to Alqualondë and her mother’s kin. During this time the two fell in love, and Teleporno gave her the romantic epithet ''[[Alatáriel]]'', meaning \"Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland\".<ref name=\"Shib\">{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> \n\nLater, Teleporno and Artanis helped to defend Alqualondë from the Noldor during the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|First Kinslaying]].<ref name=AAm/><ref name=\"GC\"/> Nevertheless, Artanis’s heart was fired by the stories of [[Fëanor]] of the open lands across the [[Belegaer|sea]]. She urged Teleporno to take a ship eastward to [[Endor]], and he gave in. In doing so the two fell under the [[Ban of the Valar]].\n\nIn Beleriand, Teleporno and Artanis were greeted by [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], [[King of Doriath]]. Teleporno eventually \"[[Sindarization|Sindarized]]\" his name to Celeborn; Artanis Sindarinized the epithet Celeborn had given her, and Alatáriel became Galadriel.\n\n{{blockquote|On the other hand, the making of Celeborn into a Telerin Elf of Aman contradicts not only statements in ''The Silmarillion'', but also those cited already from The Road Goes Ever On and Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings”|[[Christopher Tolkien]], \"[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]\"}}\nCeleborn as a Telerin prince seems a late development. This altered origin was not adopted into the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', primarily because it contradicted published [[canon]], and was not incorporated in Tolkien's drafts of the earlier parts, and therefore would have necessitated a major rewrite by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and [[Guy Gavriel Kay]] to account for a separate departure of Galadriel. It is unknown whether Tolkien would have revised the story or would have felt bound by published writings.\n\nCeleborn's Telerin ancestry would have made the couple first cousins. ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'' states that among the [[Eldar]] first cousins might marry, but seldom did so or desired to do so.<ref>{{MR|Laws}}</ref> Furthermore, the published ''Silmarillion'' states \"Eldar wedded not with kin so near,\" in reference to [[Maeglin]]'s attraction to his first cousin [[Idril]].<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Celeborn in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Angus McBride - Celeborn.jpg|Celeborn in ''[[Middle-earth: The Wizards]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Celeborn.jpg|Celeborn in [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (film series) - Celeborn 2.jpg|Celeborn in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Celeborn.jpg|Celeborn in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Celeborn.jpg|Celeborn in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1978: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''\n:Celeborn only has a brief, role and speaks only one line.

In that version, he participates in giving gifts to the Fellowship as they are leaving Lórien.  Notably, he gives [[Aragorn]] a dagger and warns him of the dangers the Fellowship will face while sailing down the [[Anduin]].  \n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Celeborn makes a brief appearance in Lothlórien.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:Celeborn leaves for Valinor with Galadriel and the other Ringbearers, rather than remaining behind as in the book.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Celeborn only appears during the \"Evil\" campaign, when he is slain by the Forces of Sauron.\n\n'''2007-: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: After the fall of [[Thangorodrim]], Celeborn spends the early years of the [[Second Age]] hunting down the surviving servants of [[Morgoth]].

A power that walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang.|[[Gandalf]] to [[Théoden]] in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Road to Isengard]]\"}}\n\n'''Treebeard''', also known as '''Fangorn''', was the oldest of the [[Ents]], a tree-like being who was a sort of \"shepherd of trees\". Very tall and stiff-limbed, with bark-like skin and leafy hair, like most Ents, Treebeard took a long time to make up his mind. He repeatedly spoke of not \"being hasty\". \n\nTreebeard is described along with [[Tom Bombadil]] as the [[eldest|oldest being]] in Middle-earth. By the later [[Third Age]], he lived in [[Fangorn Forest]], which was named after him.\n\n== History ==\nTreebeard was the [[eldest]] living being of [[Middle-earth]], having been awakened along with the Ents during the [[Years of the Trees]] of the [[First Age]], sometime after the [[Awakening of the Elves|Awakening]] of the [[Elves]], who taught the Ents to speak language in the first place;<ref name=Treebeard/>{{rp|468}} although he said that there were trees in Fangorn that were \"older than he\". His realm was the immense forest that spanned from [[Beleriand]] and [[Eriador]] to [[Calenardhon]] and saw it destroyed and diminishing by the centuries. From the [[Elder Days]], Treebeard had memories of the [[Willows|willow]]-meads of [[Tasarinan]], the [[Elms|elm]]-woods of [[Ossiriand]], the [[Pines|pine]]-trees of [[Dorthonion]] and the [[beeches]] of [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]].<ref>{{TT|III4}}, \"[[In the Willow-meads of Tasarinan]]\"</ref> \n[[File:Luca Bonatti - Farewell to Fangorn.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''Farewell to Fangorn'' by [[:Category:Images by Luca Bonatti|Luca Bonatti]]]]\nHe was with his beloved [[Fimbrethil]], but as with all of the other [[Entwives]], she left for the [[Brown Lands|gardens of the Entwives]], and had been missing ever since, especially after [[Sauron]]'s forces destroyed those lands in the [[Second Age]]. \n\nThe forests of the Ents diminished and [[Fangorn Forest]] was one of their remnants, where Treebeard and other Ents retreated. There he kept his [[Ent-houses]] one of which was the [[Wellinghall]] in the flanks of [[Methedras]].<ref name=\"Treebeard\">{{TT|III4}}</ref> \n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Treebeard and the Entmoot.jpg|200px|thumb|''Treebeard and the Entmoot'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], in [[29 February]] {{TA|3019}} he discovered [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] (\"Merry\") and [[Peregrin Took]] (\"Pippin\") after they escaped from [[Orcs]]. He welcomed them to the [[Wellinghall]]. The hobbits brought news of the Wizard Saruman's treachery and [[Orcs of Isengard|his Orcs]] damaging the trees, but Treebeard already knew of these disasters.\n\nThe Ents—usually a very patient, deliberate people—did become angry at Saruman, whose forces were cutting down large numbers of their trees. Treebeard convened an [[Entmoot]], a meeting of the Ents at [[Derndingle]].<ref name=\"Treebeard\"/>\n\nAfter lengthy deliberation Treebeard led them marching on Saruman's fortress at Isengard in [[March 3]], accompanied by the two Hobbits: the last march of the Ents. In the [[Battle of Isengard]] they destroyed the valley and trapped Saruman in the tower of Orthanc. Treebeard appointed the two Hobbits door-wardens of Orthanc. There Treebeard also saw [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] who brought a message for Saruman, and caught him and captured him inside Orthanc.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>\n\n[[5 March|Two days later]] they were soon joined by a company of [[Rohirrim]] with [[Gandalf]], returning victorious from the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. After deposing Saruman, Gandalf asked Treebeard to pour back the water into Orthanc so that Saruman can never escape. Treebeard declared that trees would return and that the new forest would be called the \"Watchwood\".<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>\n\nThe following months the Ents destroyed the [[Ring of Isengard]], filling it with trees; Treebeard saw the flight of many Orcs who met their doom in the forest. He kept their prisoner informed, who would come to the window of Orthanc to listen. \n\nEventually the Wizard withered away and eventually managed to make the Ents pity him, and on [[August 15]] they let them leave Isengard. However, before he left, Treebeard made him lock the tower and hand over the [[key of Orthanc]]. [[August 22|A week later]] Treebeard welcomed [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and company at Orthanc, and related these news.\n\nPresumably Treebeard stayed for some time in the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]], which King Elessar declared an Entish realm.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Pronounce|Fangorn.mp3|Ardamir}}\nTreebeard is the direct translation of the [[Sindarin]] name ''Fangorn'', from ''[[fang]]'' (\"beard\") and ''[[orn]]'' (\"tree\").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 84</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn early versions of [[The Lord of the Rings]], Treebeard was an evil [[Giants|Giant]] who was in league with the [[Sauron|Enemy]].

Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn... he knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless – before the Dark Lord came from Outside.|Tom Bombadil in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[In the House of Tom Bombadil]]\"}}\n\n'''Tom Bombadil''' was an enigmatic figure who lived throughout the history of [[Arda]]. Living a short distance east of the [[Old Forest]], he seemed to possess unequaled power in the land around his dwelling. Although seemingly benevolent, he took no stance against the [[Dark Lord]]s.\n\n==Appearance and traits==\n{{quote|Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;<br>Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.|Tom Bombadil}}\n\nTom looked like an old man who was taller and heavier than a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], but not quite tall enough for a [[Men|man]].<ref name=\"OldF\" />\n\nHis face was creased and red as a ripe apple with blue and bright eyes.<ref name=\"OldF\" /> His hands were brown-skinned.<ref name=\"house\" /> He had thick brown hair<ref name=\"house\" /> and a long brown beard.<ref name=\"OldF\" />  \n\nTom wore a blue coat and an old tall hat with a long blue feather and yellow boots.<ref name=\"OldF\" /> Earlier he wore a [[swans|swan]] feather, which he later replaced with a blue one from a [[kingfishers|kingfisher]].<ref>{{AB|2}}</ref>\n\nHe lived in a [[Underhill (house)|house]] just outside the eastern edge of the [[Old Forest]] by the river [[Withywindle]],<ref name=\"OldF\" /> together with his lovely wife [[Goldberry]].<ref name=\"house\" /> According to him<ref name=\"FR|Barrow\">{{FR|Barrow}}</ref> and to [[Gandalf]] as well,<ref name=\"CoE\" /> he would not leave his country. The only known location on the border of his country is where he makes that statement, on the south side of the [[East Road]], north of the [[Barrow-downs]] and about four miles northwest of [[Bree]]. His country must have included the Barrow-downs and the [[Old Forest]], and according to the poem \"[[Bombadil Goes Boating]],\" he visited villages in [[Buckland]] and [[Farmer Maggot]]'s farm in the [[Marish]], which would mean that his country included them as well.\n\nThe [[Bucklanders]] had little understanding of his powers and nature. They saw him as mysterious and unpredictable, but benevolent and comic, more or less as the [[Shire-folk]] thought of [[Gandalf]].<ref name=\"Adv\" />\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[Image:Olanda Fong-Surdenas - Tom Bombadil.jpg|thumb|left|''Tom Bombadil'' by [[Olanda Fong-Surdenas]]]]\n{{quote|He is a strange creature.|[[Elrond]], ''[[The Council of Elrond]]''}}\nThe origins and [[Tom Bombadil/Nature|nature of Tom Bombadil]] are unknown. He claims to have existed when the [[Morgoth|Dark Lord]] came \"from the Outside\",<ref name=\"house\">{{FR|Bombadil}}</ref>{{rp|131}} perhaps meaning he was alive at least as far back as the [[Spring of Arda]].<ref>{{RS|Tom}}, p. 122</ref> Bombadil calls himself the \"Eldest\", [[Glorfindel]] calls him the \"First\", and his Sindarin name ''Iarwain Ben-adar'' means \"Oldest and fatherless.\"\n\nHis role and nature in the [[Elder Days]] and later is unknown.  He was in Arda \"before the river and the trees\" and before the first rain. He \"made paths\" before the [[Great March]] of the [[Eldar]], and saw the [[Middle Men]] and their [[Barrow Downs|tombs]]. He witnessed the [[Changing of the World]], the reducing of the great forests that covered all [[Middle-earth]], the arrival of the [[Exiles of Númenor]] and of the [[Barrow-wights]].<ref name=\"house\" /><ref name=\"CoE\" /> \n\nThe nature of his interactions with the outside world is unclear. He had contact with the [[Bucklanders]] throughout the [[Third Age]].<ref name=\"Adv\" /> He was familiar with Frodo, his companions and their families when they visit him. He attributed most of this knowledge to [[Farmer Maggot]].<ref name=\"house\" /> He had names among the Elves, Dwarves and Northern Men. [[Elrond]] knew of him when he ventured in his lands. However, most of the [[Council of Elrond]] were unfamiliar with him, and Elrond admitted to having forgotten about him from long ago.<ref name=\"CoE\" /><ref name=\"Adv\">{{AB|Preface}}</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - The Willow Man is Tamed.jpg|thumb|''The Willow Man is Tamed'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nOn [[26 September]], {{TA|3018}}, he encountered [[travellers|four hobbits]] while he was searching for water-lilies for his wife. Two of those Hobbits, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], had been captured by [[Old Man Willow]]. Tom, who was the master of the Old Forest, rescued them, and took all four of them to his house.<ref name=\"OldF\">{{FR|Forest}}</ref>\n\nThe four hobbits stayed two nights, and he told them many tales and songs. With cunning questions, he made [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] tell him of the [[The One Ring|Ring]]. When Tom tried it on, nothing happened, but he then took it off and flipped it in the air and made the ring itself disappear, showing that indeed within his realm Tom was master. However, when Frodo put the ring on, Tom could still see him. He bade the Hobbit to come back and sit down; his hand was fairer without the ring.\n\nBefore his guests went to sleep, Tom warned them of the [[Barrow-downs]], and advised them to pass any barrow on the western side. He also taught them a song, should they come to peril.<ref name=\"house\" />{{rp|134}}\n\nAnd they did come to peril. Tom chased off a [[Barrow-wights|wight]] with song, and broke the spells on the barrow in which the four hobbits were captured. While he sent the Hobbits to calm down, he went for provisions. He also brought the ponies that had belonged to Merry. After that, he broke the spells of the barrow. From the barrow's mighty hoard, he took a blue-jewelled brooch for Goldberry (probably belonging to the spouse of the [[last prince of Cardolan]] he seemingly met long ago),<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"Fog on the Barrow-downs\", pp. 146-7</ref><ref>{{RS|Wight}}, p. 127-8</ref> and gave a [[Daggers of Westernesse|dagger]] to each of the hobbits. He then advised them to make for ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' in [[Bree]].<ref name=\"FR|Barrow\" />\n\nThe peril of the hobbits was not over; an attack on their lives was carried out, and their ponies were set loose. The ponies apparently remembered the care they were given in the house of Tom Bombadil, and returned to stay beside Tom's own pony, [[Fatty Lumpkin]]. He returned them to [[Barliman Butterbur]], the proprietor of ''The Prancing Pony''. Since he had paid eighteen pence as compensation for the loss, he was now the owner of five fine ponies.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref>\n\nAs he was merry and benevolent, some of the [[Free Peoples]] considered him a potential ally against [[Sauron]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Elrond]] and [[Erestor]] considered that he should be present at the [[Council of Elrond]]. However, according to [[Gandalf]], Tom Bombadil was perhaps not fully aware of the struggle of Light and Darkness and could not prove useful to their causes.<ref name=\"CoE\" />\n\nAfter the [[fall of Sauron]] at the end of the War, the [[Travelers]] returned to the Shire, but Gandalf left them and went to talk to Tom.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>{{rp|996}}\n\nEventually the defeat of Sauron and the victory of the [[West]] allowed Tom to continue and \"survive\" in the [[later Ages]].<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> \n\n===Legacy===\nTom Bombadil’s existence passed into Hobbit lore and was referenced in poems such as ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]''. The Hobbit, [[Samwise Gamgee]], based and modeled his protagonist in ''[[The Stone Troll]]'', [[Tom (The Stone Troll)|Tom]], after Bombadil, considering that Sam composed the poem soon after their meeting.<ref name=\"RF\">{{HM|Guide}}, p. 385</ref> In the poem, Tom encounters an old [[Stone-trolls|troll]], gnawing for years on the shinbone of Tim, his [[Unusual words|nuncle]], and Tom demands for the troll to let it down.<ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref><ref>{{AB|7}}</ref> It is likely that Tim was only an invention by Sam rather than actually being Tom Bombadil's nuncle.<ref name=\"RF\" />\n\n==Other names==\nHe also went by other names: \n*The [[Elves]] called him '''''[[iaur|Iar]]<nowiki/>wain [[penadar|Ben-adar]]'''''<ref name=\"CoE\">{{FR|Council}}, p. 265</ref> in [[Sindarin]]<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry S ''pen-'', p. 34</ref>, which translates to \"Oldest and Fatherless\"<ref name=\"CoE\" />. ''Iarwain'' literally means \"Old-young\", presumably because he had always appeared to be much the same: \"old, but very vigorous\"<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 128; quoting an unpublished letter from late 1968 by J.R.R. Tolkien from a private collection</ref>\n*The \"[[Northmen|Northern Men]]\" gave him the name '''''Orald'''''.<ref name=\"CoE\" /> ''Orald'' is an [[Old English]] word meaning \"very ancient\". Old English represents \"the [[Rohanese|language of the Rohirrim and their kin]]\".<ref name=\"nomen\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Orald''', p. 761</ref>\n*The Dwarves gave him the name '''''Forn'''''.<ref name=\"CoE\" /> ''Forn'' is  [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] for \"(belonging to) ancient (days)\".<ref name=\"nomen\" /> Since all the dwarf names are in Old Norse, which represents \"a [[Northern Mannish|northern language of Men]]\"<ref name=\"nomen\" /> and the Dwarves from the region of Dale took their \"outer\" names in the [[language of Dale]]<ref>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1137</ref>, it is possible that the name ''Forn'' came from the [[language of Dale]]. In some imprints of ''[[The History of Middle-earth Index]]'', this name was accidentally spelled with a \"P\" as the first letter: {{HM|IX}}, \"Tom Bombadil (VII)\", p. 435<nowiki></ref></nowiki>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Bombadil'' is [[Bucklandish]] in form. It is probable that the [[Bucklanders|Hobbits from Buckland]] gave him this name.<ref name=\"Adv\" />\n\n[[Paula Marmor]] notes that ''bobadil'' is an archaic word meaning \"braggart\", as seen in the character \"Captain Bobadill\" in the English play ''[[Wikipedia:Every Man in His Humour|Every Man in His Humour]]''. Because of its Bucklandish form, ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'' lists the name ''Bombadil'' under the \"[[Celtic]]-sounding names\". However, it is said that the word derives from '''[[Wikipedia:Boabdil|Boabdil]]''', the Spaniard name of [[Wikipedia:Muhammad XII of Granada|'''Abu Abdillah''' Muhammad XII]], the last Moorish ruler of Granada.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nTom Bombadil was inspired primarily from a [[Wikipedia:Peg wooden doll|dutch doll]] Tolkien's child(ren) toyed with.<ref name=\"intro\" /> The doll had a feathered hat. One time they found it in the lavatory, being stuffed there by little [[John Tolkien]], who perhaps didn't like it much.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 165</ref>\n\nTolkien began (probably in the 1920s) writing a story entitled ''Tom Bombadil'' set during the reign of \"King Bonhedig\" in the British prehistory, far before any recorded events or invasions. The protagonist Tombombadil is mentioned as one of the oldest inhabitants of Bonhedig's kingdom, which spanned many miles on either side of the Thames. Only the 3 opening paragraphs survive of the shortly-abandoned, story, and the fragment ends at the description of Tombombadil who \"wore a tall hat with a blue feather; his jacket was blue, and his boots were yellow\".<ref>{{AB|Prose}}</ref>\n\nAround the 1930s or earlier Tolkien wrote a poem about some Tom Bombadil rowing down a River, a poem which Tolkien later identified as his \"germ of Tom Bombadil\".<ref>{{RS|1VT}}</ref> Later in [[1934]] he put him into [[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (poem)|a poem]], again described according to the appearance of the aforementioned doll (something that he did with other toys of his children, like [[Rover]]).<ref name=\"intro\">{{AB|Intro}}</ref> At one time he described him as a \"spirit of the (vanishing) [[Oxford]] and Berkshire countryside\"<ref name=\"L19\">{{L|19}}</ref> \n\nWhen asked to make a sequel for ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Tolkien briefly considered making that figure of his poem the central character.<ref name=\"L19\" /> Although it didn't happen, he eventually [[The Old Forest|appeared]] in the narrative as a supporting character. Tolkien wrote Bombadil as a direct contrast to the artistry and (sub)creative force of the [[Elves]]; whereas they seek to create, devise, alter and control, Bombadil only observes and contemplates the world outside him and takes joy in it. He is the fearless theoretical study of the world, and history.<ref name=\"coghill\">[[Letter to Nevill Coghill]] (Excerpt reproduced [http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/tom-bombadil-addenda-corrigenda/ here])</ref>\n\nJustin Noetzel in his paper \"Beorn and Tom Bombadil: Mythology, Narrative, and The Most (Non) Essential Characters in Middle-earth\", suggests an association of Tom Bombadil with the [[Wikipedia:Celtic Otherworld|Celtic Otherworld]] and tales of the [[Wikipedia:Tuatha Dé Danann|Tuatha Dé Danann]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John D. Rateliff]]|articleurl=http://sacnoths.blogspot.se/2013/03/valparaiso-day-three.html|articlename=Valparaiso, Day Three|dated=12 March 2013|website=Sac|accessed=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nDavid Elton Gay compares Tom to the demigod [[Wikipedia:Väinämöinen|Väinämöinen]] from the ''[[Kalevala]]'': both are extremely old and powerful immortal figures who express their power in rhymes, and both have control over their small forested country.<ref>Gay, David Elton (2004). Chance, Jane (ed.). ''J.R.R. Tolkien and the Kalevala. Tolkien and the invention of myth : a reader''. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 295–304.</ref>\n\n==Outside the legendarium==\nIn addition to the aforementioned earlier works written independently to the [[Legendarium]], a figure that hints at Bombadil appears in the much later poem ''[[Once upon a Time]]''. Tolkien wrote it around [[1964]] and reused the names of \"Tom\" and \"Goldberry\" (although the epithet \"Bombadil\" is not mentioned, the association can be made as he appears with Goldberry). Hammond & Scull note that in this poem Tom appears less omnipotent; while he is known to talk to all creatures, who always obey him, the mysterious ''[[lintips]]'' are the only ones who refuse to talk to him and hide away.<ref>{{AB|Once}}, p. 283</ref> No specific events are mentioned that can connect it to Tom Bombadil or the legendarium of Arda.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\nBecause he is left out of the three major adaptations ([[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|Ralph Bakshi]], [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|BBC's 1981 series]] and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|Peter Jackson's]]), Tom Bombadil's main role (providing the [[Daggers of Westernesse|Barrow-blades]]) is omitted.

Like Norman Shelley before him, he also voiced [[Gandalf]].\n\n'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''\n:Tom Bombadil can be found outside his house in the Old Forest.\n\n'''1990: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (1990 video game)|J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I]]'':'''\n:Tom Bombadil rescues the party from the Willow Man, and provides information, supplies, shelter, and side-quests for the party.  He later rescues the party from the Barrow Wights, and very briefly joins as a temporary playable character while inside the barrow.  His role runs almost directly parallel to the original, with some related passages of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' quoted directly.  However, [[Goldberry]]'s role is significantly changed to provide a quest for the party.\n\n'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''\n:Tom Bombadil is played by Peter Ehrlich.\n\n'''1992: [[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|''Tales from the Perilous Realm'' (1992 radio series)]]:'''\n:When he adapted the 1981 [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|radio series]], [[Brian Sibley]] deeply regretted cutting Bombadil from the radio series.<ref>[[Brian Sibley]], ''[http://briansibleytheworks.blogspot.com/2008/01/this-page-is-still-under-construction_23.html The Ring Goes Ever On]''</ref> When he made ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm]]'' into a radio series, he decided to change the section \"[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]\". Rather than several (unadaptable) Hobbitish poems, Sibley adapted the chapters from ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. Bombadil is voiced by [[Ian Hogg]].\n\n'''1993: ''[[Hobitit]]'':'''\n:Tom Bombadil is portrayed by Esko Hukkanen. It is the only screen adaptation that featured him before 2024.\n\n'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''\n:Although Tom Bombadil does not appear in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], Decipher produced a card for the character. He was portrayed by Harry Weller-Chew.\n\n'''2001–present: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'':'''\n:Despite not appearing in the films the game is based on, Tom Bombadil and Goldberry were given several models by [[Games Workshop]], which has held rights for tabletop games since 1980.\n\n'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Tom Bombadil is provided by Milan Lasica. He appears in the final third of the first episode, helping the four hobbits with Old Man Willow, guiding them to his house and taking them in as his guests for the night, along with his wife Goldberry. After they depart and get lost on the Barrow Downs, he once again aids in their rescue, and provides them with barrow-blades from the barrow of the defeated barrow-wight.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:[[Daran Norris]] portrayed Bombadil with a Scottish accent. His role is much like that in the book, and as one of the few characters in this video game, he keeps most of his songs.\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|extended edition]], some of Bombadil's poems are transferred to [[Treebeard]], and so is his encounter with [[Old Man Willow]].\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Bombadil is a summonable power. Once summoned, he can plow through enemy lines. His most powerful weapon is a \"Sonic Song\". As soon as [[Electronic Arts|EA]] secured the rights to the books, it was decided that Tom Bombadil should be in it; his appearance is kept close to his description in the book.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/battleformiddleearth2/news.html?sid=6139678 The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle-earth II Q&A - Enter Tom Bombadil], [http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot.com]</ref>\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Tom can be found either inside or outside his house in the Old Forest. He helps the player track down crebain scouts possessing important information, and later arrives to rescue the player from the Barrow-Downs when (s)he gets himself in more than (s)he is prepared for, much like the Hobbits in the Book. He later aids the player against agents of the Barrow-downs when the latter attempts to corrupt Old Man Willow with a [[Morgul-blade]].\n\n'''2012: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]'':'''\n:Bombadil is a playable character.  He uses a trowel as a weapon and for digging in certain spots. Tom can be found in his house on the road to the north of [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in the forested area between [[Bree]] and the Shire. It is unclear if this forest is meant to be the Old Forest or not; it is in the right location, but the game never specifically names it and its physical appearance does not fit the book's description.\n\n'''2014: ''[[Lego The Hobbit: The Video Game]]'':'''\n:Bombadil also appears as a playable character, and again wields a trowel. This time, Tom is found in a forest southwest of Bree, near a house atop a hill (likely his house in the Old Forest).\n\n'''2024: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:Tom Bombadil will be portrayed by [[Rory Michael Kinnear]], whose headwear and outfit was made by costume designer Luca Mosca to look similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's description of Tom Bombadil. The production designer of the show, [[Kristian Milstead]], incorporated a star map on the ceiling of Tom's cottage to imply that Bombadil \"has been watching the constellations for signs—and for the Stranger’s arrival\", thereby connecting Tom to the larger story. The showrunners mention that they have given him a second home besides [[Underhill (house)|Underhill]] which he uses as a \"summer cottage\" on the outskirts of the once \"green and beautiful\" [[Rhûn]] \"which...now is...a dead wasteland\". At the time of the show, Bombadil \"has gone out to...Rhûn...to see what's happened\" to the region in order to prevent the desolation from spreading westwards.<ref>{{webcite|author=Anthony Breznican|articleurl=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/tom-bombadil-the-rings-of-power-first-look|articlename=Tom Bombadil Finally Steps Forth in ''The Rings of Power'' - An Exclusive First Look|dated=29 May 2024|website=[https://www.vanityfair.com Vanity Fair]|accessed=29 May 2024}}</ref>\n\n===Collectibles===\nIn [[April]] [[2008]], [[Gentle Giant]] released the Tom Bombadil Mini Bust.\n\n==See also==\n*'''[[Tom Bombadil/Nature|The Nature of Tom Bombadil]]'''\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/t/tombombadil.html Entry in the Encyclopedia of Arda] (a concise overview of the discussion)\n*[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2012/08/27/count-count-weigh-divide/ Count, Count, Weigh, Divide] by [[Michael Martinez]] (discusses Tom Bombadil's moral aspects at length)\n*[http://www.whoistombombadil.blogspot.com/2013/01/tom-bombadil-as-music-of-ainur_9.html Tom as the Music of the Ainur] discusses the major theories of Tom's origins and proposes a new theory.\n*[http://www.cas.unt.edu/~hargrove/tombomb.html Who Is Tom Bombadil?] (an essay by Gene Hargrove)\n\n{{References|Notes}}\n{{Ringbearers}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]\n[[Category:Enigmas]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Forest-folk]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Tom Bombadil]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/tom bombadil]]\n[[fi:Tom Bombadil]]",

The [[hobbits]] thought of her as a beautiful and calm being, with a beauty resembling an [[Elf]] but less exotic to their hearts.

Some show themselves openly, others are secretive and only reveal themselves to the Wise and the descendants of the [[Númenóreans]] who had known of River-maidens in the years of old.

During the [[First Age]], he was the lord of the [[House of the Golden Flower]] of [[Gondolin]], and died fighting a [[Balrog]]. After his re-embodiment, he was allowed to come back to Middle-earth in the [[Second Age]], acting as an emissary of the [[Valar]], on a similar mission to the [[Wizards|Istari]] who were to come several years later.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nGlorfindel was born in [[Valinor]] sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]]. During the [[Exile of the Noldor]], he was of the host of [[Turgon]]. Glorfindel himself was reluctant; only for his allegiance and kinship with Turgon did he go, and had no part in the [[Kinslaying of Alqualondë]].<ref name=\"PoME-LW\">{{PM|Last}}, \"Glorfindel I & II\"</ref>{{rp|380}}\n\n===Life in Gondolin===\nAfter the Return of the Noldor to [[Middle-earth]], Glorfindel's history is obscure. As a great follower of Turgon he was appointed chief of the [[House of the Golden Flower]], one of the [[Twelve houses of the Gondothlim|noble houses]] of [[Gondolin]]. He was dearly loved by all the [[Gondolindrim]].\n\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Glorfindel and Ecthelion.jpg|thumb|left|''Glorfindel and Ecthelion'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\nHe followed [[Turgon]] who surprisingly came to fight in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. When the war turned against the [[Union of Maedhros|alliance]], Turgon's and [[Fingon]]'s forces retreated to the [[Pass of Sirion]] with Glorfindel and [[Ecthelion]] guarding their flanks.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Glorfindel's Bane.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorfindel's Bane'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nIn the year {{FA|510}},<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> [[Morgoth]] sent a great force against Gondolin, resulting in the complete destruction of the city. The tale of this battle was well detailed in ''[[#Other versions of the legendarium|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', and long remembered by the elves. Glorfindel managed to escape the [[Fall of Gondolin]] with the [[Exiles of Gondolin|Exiles]], and after crossing [[Tumladen]] they reached the [[Cirith Thoronath]], a narrow pass between the mountains. There the survivors were attacked by an ambush of [[Orcs]] led by a [[Balrog]]. The [[Eagles]] came to help them, but Glorfindel fought the Balrog alone upon the pinnacle of a rock. Both died after falling in the abyss, and their duel is sung of by many songs. [[Thorondor]] rescued Glorfindel's body, and a cairn was raised, which remained there, covered by grass and yellow flowers, [[War of Wrath|until the world changed]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\n===Re-embodiment and return to Middle-earth===\nGlorfindel's spirit passed to the [[Halls of Waiting]], where he waited with the spirits of the other Noldor who had died during their war against [[Morgoth]]. But because of Glorfindel's noble actions in life, his reluctance at the Exile, and his furthering of the purposes of the Valar by saving Tuor and Idril, Manwë allowed his re-embodiment after only a short time. Being already an Elda of great corporal and spiritual stature, in his new incarnated life his spiritual power was enhanced by his self-sacrifice. He lived in Valinor for many years in the company of the Eldar and the [[Maiar]], the latter also regarding him as an equal, for he was incarnate. At some point, he became a follower of [[Olórin]], a Maia with special concern for Middle-earth.<ref name=\"PoME-LW\" />{{rp|380–381}}\n\nEventually, [[Manwë]] sent him across the [[Belegaer|sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Second Age]]. He possibly came as early as {{SA|1200}}, but more likely in {{SA|1600}},<ref name=\"PoME-LW\" />{{rp|381–382}} at the same time as the [[Blue Wizards]].<ref>{{PM|XIII}}, \"The Five Wizards\", p. 384</ref> If he arrived in S.A. 1600, he arrived just after [[the One Ring]] had been forged, [[Barad-dûr]] built, and [[Celebrimbor]] dead or soon to be so. While the Blue Wizards were sent to the east, Glorfindel's mission was to aid [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] in the struggle against [[Sauron]].<ref name=\"PoME-LW\" />{{rp|382}} He may have played a prominent behind-the-scenes role in the war in [[Eriador]] and the other struggles of the [[Second Age]] and [[Third Age]]. His part, though great, was mostly overlooked by the histories, because his immense, angelic power was not usually displayed openly.\n\n===Third Age===\nOver time, as the few remaining great Elves of Middle-earth took ship to Aman or fell one by one, only [[Galadriel]], [[Celeborn]], [[Elrond]], and [[Círdan]] were left of the Wise. Glorfindel took a more active role, leading the Elven forces in the [[Battle of Fornost]]. Upon the humiliation of [[Eärnur]] before the [[Witch-king]], Glorfindel bade him not pursue, and prophesied that the wraith would not fall by the hand of man.<ref>{{App|A1iv}}</ref> Not much can be said about his deeds and role in the events and struggles of the [[Westlands]] before the [[War of the Ring]].\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Glorfindel.jpg|thumb|''Glorfindel'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nDuring the War, he was one of the elves dispatched from [[Rivendell]] by Elrond to search for the [[Ring-bearer]]. Elrond had chosen him partially because Glorfindel did not fear the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], as he had great presence in both the [[Seen]] and [[Unseen]] worlds. While on his perilous mission the Ringwraiths avoided him; he met five of them, and they fled at his presence. It was Glorfindel indeed who accomplished his mission and found the Ringbearer, [[Frodo Baggins]], and his friend [[Aragorn]] with him. Glorfindel put Frodo on his horse, [[Asfaloth]], and upon the approach of the Ringwraiths ordered him to go on. The white horse bore Frodo to safety across the [[Ford of Bruinen]], but Frodo, in a rash act of attempted heroism, turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. Glorfindel, expecting the flood that protected Rivendell to come down and smite the riders, revealed his power to the Riders, and drove them (willingly or not) into the River, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.<ref name = \"Flight to the Ford\"></ref>\n\nAfter this adventure, he helped bear Frodo to Rivendell, where the wounded Ringbearer was tended to. Glorfindel attended the [[Council of Elrond]], playing an active role in the conversation, speaking prophetically of [[Tom Bombadil]] and other matters with authority. Glorfindel stood beside Elrond and Gandalf as the backbone of the Council, laying out clearly their options. At first Glorfindel suggested that the Ring would be safe in the depths of the Sea, but the far-sighted Gandalf noted the change of landscapes, and the unforeseen possibilities that could bring the Ring forth once more in a hundred or even a thousand years in the future. He was briefly considered as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], but as his friend Gandalf said, Glorfindel's power would be of little use against the might of [[Mordor]], on a mission of secrecy.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]] nothing is said of Glorfindel. Whatever his role, he survived and joined Elrond's company to the Wedding of Elessar.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> After that no more is said of him. Like Olórin, his task in Middle-earth was done, and the age of the [[Elves]] was over. He probably passed into the West, perhaps accompanying the bearers of the [[Three Rings]] and [[the One Ring]]. Or he may have remained in Middle-earth for some time to oversee the post-war recovery before eventually departing for [[Valinor]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Glorfindel.mp3|Ardamir}}\nWith the development of the [[Elvish]] languages, the name ''Glorfindel'' had different etymologies, ultimately meaning the same. \n\nThe early [[Gnomish]] conception meant \"Goldtress\" or \"Goldlocks\". At this stage of the legendarium, [[Tolkien]] considered many other variants, like ''Glorfinn'' or ''Glorfing''.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Glorfindel\"</ref> [[Qenya]] cognates were '''''Laurifindl''''' or '''''Kulufindl'''''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>\n\nAt the [[Noldorin]] stage, the name was composed of the words ''[[glaur]]'' (\"gold\") + ''findel/finnel'' (\"braided hair\"),<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries \"[[LAWAR]]\", \"SPIN\"</ref> but it is not properly glossed.\n\nIn the final [[Sindarin]] conception, ''Glorfindel'' meant \"Golden-hair\", from ''glaur'' (\"gold\") + ''findel'' (\"head of hair\").<ref name=\"Eldarin\">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|17}} It was supposedly derived from the [[Quenya]] form '''''Laurefindelë'''''.<ref name=\"Eldarin\" />{{rp|119}} Tolkien also created a [[Primitive Quendian]] version: ''Malaphindë'' (\"Goldilocks\"), which is mentioned as an ''[[anessë]]'' (a given name).<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 86</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | |F|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|7| |}}\n{{familytree | | | |:| | | | | | | | | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | | | |:| | | | | | | | | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | | | TUR |y| ELE | | | | GLO |GLO='''GLORFINDEL'''<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|TUR=[[Turgon]]<br/><small>''{{YT|1300}} - {{FA|510}}''</small>|ELE=[[Elenwë]]<br/><small>''d. {{YT|1500}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | TUO |y| IDR | | | | | | | | |IDR=[[Idril]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|TUO=[[Tuor]]<br/><small>''b. {{FA|472}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | EAR | | | | | | | | | | |EAR=[[Eärendil]]<br/><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===Early legendarium===\n====''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''====\nThe most detailed text about the deeds of Glorfindel during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\", in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. There he is described as the chief of the [[House of the Golden Flower]], who bore a rayed sun upon their shields. He wore a mantle embroidered in threads of gold, decorated with celandine \"as a field in spring\", while his arms were [[Uncommon words#D|damascened]] with \"cunning gold\".<ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|173}} \n\nGlorfindel witnessed the coming of [[Tuor]] and later the [[Fall of Gondolin]]. During the ensuing battle in the streets, Glorfindel chose (or was ordered) to hold the [[Great Market]] from the advancing [[Orcs]]. He attempted to flank them, taking the enemy by surprise, but was himself ambushed and surrounded. Cut off, the House of the Golden Flower fought on fiercely for hours, until a fire-breathing [[Dragons|dragon]] came and levelled their ranks. Glorfindel, with some of the strongest of his followers, cut his way out, but the survivors of that battle were very few. Even then they were pursued and might have all been killed, but the [[House of the Harp]] arrived in time, after rebelling from their treacherous leader [[Salgant]], ambushing their pursuers. The Golden Flower arrived at the [[Square of the King]], one of the last of the houses to be driven in.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|182}} \n\nAs many of the lords had fallen, [[Ecthelion]] was wounded, [[Galdor (elf of Gondolin)|Galdor]] was engaged, and [[Egalmoth]] had not yet arrived, Glorfindel joined Tuor in leading the defence of the King's Square. When Egalmoth arrived, bringing with him many women and children, he took over Glorfindel's job in going from place to place, strengthening the defences. Glorfindel presumably threw himself once more into the thick of the fight. But even he could not prevent a dragon from coming down from the [[Alley of Roses]], breaking through their lines. The dragon was accompanied by orcs and balrogs, among them [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]]. Even Tuor was thrown down, but Ecthelion sacrificed himself to kill Gothmog and buy the Gondothlim a little more time.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|183–4}} After King Turgon ordered the survivors to follow Tuor, they fled southward, and Glorfindel held the rear manfully, losing many more of his House in the process.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|186}}\n\nAfter they had escaped Gondolin via [[Idril's secret way]], and passed through the [[Cristhorn]], Glorfindel again held the rear with the largest number of the unwounded. It was at that time that a Balrog and a contingent of Orcs ambushed their company.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|192–3}} There Glorfindel saved the lives of the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] when he defied the Balrog:\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Glorfindel and the Balrog Above Gondolin.jpg|thumb|''Glorfindel and the Balrog above Gondolin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\n{{blockquote|Then Glorfindel leapt forward upon him and his golden armour gleamed strangely in the moon, and he hewed at that demon that it leapt again upon a great boulder and Glorfindel after. Now there was a deadly combat upon that high rock above the folk; and these, pressed behind and hindered ahead, were grown so close that well nigh all could see, yet was it over ere Glorfindel's men could leap to his side. The ardour of Glorfindel drave that Balrog from point to point, and his mail fended him from its whip and claw. Now had he beaten a heavy swinge upon its iron helm, now hewn off the creature's whip-arm at the elbow. Then sprang the Balrog in the torment of his pain and fear full at Glorfindel, who stabbed like a dart of a snake; but he found only a shoulder, and was grappled, and they swayed to a fall upon the crag-top. Then Glorfindel's left hand sought a dirk, and this he thrust up that it pierced the Balrog's belly nigh his own face (for that demon was double his stature); and it shrieked, and fell backwards from the rock, and falling clutched Glorfindel's yellow locks beneath his cap, and those twain fell into the abyss.}}\n\nThe [[Noldoli]] still mourned the death of Glorfindel, and every time the [[Eldar]] saw a powerful fight between good and evil, they still said: \"''Alas! 'Tis Glorfindel and the Balrog''\". After the body of Glorfindel was recovered by Thorndor, Tuor allowed the folk of the Golden Flower to rise a cairn for him, there near the dangerous [[Thorn Sir]]. Despite being a unkindly place, yellow flowers grew upon the mound, and the place was always protected by Thorndor.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|194}}\n\n====''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''====\nIn a hasty note about the Council of Elrond, Tolkien suggested that Glorfindel could tell of his ancestry in Gondolin, but this idea was never developed.<ref name=\"Ancestry\">{{RS|1XI}}, p. 214</ref>\n\nGlorfindel was originally planned to be part of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], in a way taking the place of [[Legolas]].<ref>{{RS|4XXIII}}, pp. 397-8, 406</ref>\n\n===Later legendarium===\n====''[[The War of the Jewels]]''====\nWhile composing the chapter about [[Maeglin]], [[Tolkien]] considered Glorfindel, [[Ecthelion]] and [[Egalmoth]] as the escort of Aredhel when she left the [[Gondolin|Hidden City]] in her way to visit [[Fingon]].<ref name=\"Maeglin\" />{{rp|318}} However, in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] didn't mention any of the escorts of Aredhel, based on a note in which his father discussed about the motives of Celegorm and Curufin of not sending any message to Gondolin about Aredhel. Tolkien decided that it was necessary ''not'' to name the most eminent and bravest chieftains as Aredhel's escort, as they would have sought for her beyond the [[Iant Iaur]].<ref name=\"Maeglin\">{{WJ|Maeglin}}</ref>{{rp|328}}\n\n====''[[Last Writings]]''====\nTolkien first suggested that Glorfindel returned to Middle-earth about {{TA|1000}}, with [[Gandalf]].<ref name=\"PoME-LW\" />{{rp|377}} But he later realized that Glorfindel only could come ''before'' the end of the Second Age and the [[Drowning of Númenor]], as with the [[Changing of the World]] Aman was removed from the [[Circles of the World]] and no living embodied creature could return from there. This was directly decreed by [[Ilúvatar]] to favour the [[Dominion of Men]]. It seems improbable that Manwë would have obtained special permission and devised a way of transportation, as that would seem to give Glorfindel an excessive importance.<ref name=\"PoME-LW\" />{{rp|381–2}}\n\nAs told above, Glorfindel might have come as early as {{SA|1200}} and the years following, or as late as {{SA|1600}}. Although Tolkien declared the first to be possible, he favoured the last as the most probable.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\nGlorfindel is rarely portrayed like in the book. In adaptations, there is usually not enough time to properly introduce a character that has little to do with the main plot. In the more popular works, his role has been filled by another Elf.\n\n===Glorfindel in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Sagan om Ringen - Glorfindel.jpg|''[[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|Sagan om Ringen]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Glorfindel.JPG|[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Glorfindel.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (film series) - Glorfindel.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''\nFile:BFME2 - Glorfindel.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Glorfindel.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Lego The Lord of the Rings The Video Game - Glorfindel.jpg|''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''\n:This short Swedish adaptation of the first half of the Fellowship of the Ring is unusual among film adaptations in that shows Glorfindel fight the Nazgûl rather than have another character absorb his role.\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:In this adaptation, the role of Glorfindel was taken by [[Legolas]]. In a simplification of that character, and as a reason for ''his'' coming, he is portrayed as an Elf of Rivendell rather than [[Mirkwood]].\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Glorfindel appears in his original role at the Last Bridge, voiced by [[John Webb]]. Because the part of [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] was cut, the heavily wounded Frodo says the [[Quenya]] greeting ''[[Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo]]'' to him, and Glorfindel replies with Gildor's answer. Glorfindel keeps his two [[Sindarin]] lines, ''[[A na vedui, Dúnadan!]]'' and ''[[Noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!]]'', though he says them with a heavy English accent. Glorfindel's role at the Council of Elrond is omitted.  His name is pronounced correctly in the adaptation, but in the credits, his name is pronounced \"Glorfindle\".\n\n'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''\n:Glorfindel is a powerful playable character once [[the One Ring|the Ring]] passes the [[Last Bridge]], who leads the Fellowship to [[Rivendell]].\n\n'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''\n:Glorfindel is played by Stefan Schwartz.\n\n'''1995: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''\n:Glorfindel appears in ''The Wizards'' expansion. He is named Glorfindel II, though is still intended to be the Glorfindel from The Fellowship of the Ring. The most likely explanation for this would be that the creator of the card was unaware that The Silmarillion's Glorfindel was the same character as the one that appears in Fellowship.\n\n'''1996: ''J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit: An Adventure Play''''': \n:In this children's theater script by Edward Mast, the show opens with [[Bilbo Baggins]] putting on a shadow play for the audience of Glorfindel's battle with the Balrog at the Fall of Gondolin to establish his love of telling adventurous tales. The allure of having his own story just as adventurous, though hopefully with a less tragic end, plays a role in convincing Bilbo to join [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s company.\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:To limit the already large number of one-appearance characters, Glorfindel has been omitted in this adaptation as well. [[Peter Jackson]] decided to have [[Arwen]] meet the travellers and then ride on [[Asfaloth]].\n\n'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Glorfindel is provided by Marián Zednikovič.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Glorfindel appears on the Last Bridge. He has several Sindarin lines: ''A na vedui, Dúnadan'', like in the book, and ''Mae govannen, mellon'' (which Frodo accurately translates as \"Well met, friend\"). He comes to the aid of the hobbits at the request of Elrond, who had received news from [[Gildor|a group of Elves travelling near the Shire]] - even though there is no mention of that group earlier in the gameplay. Glorfindel does so in a monotonous voice, and his speech continues without pause. He also uses the lines ''Noro lim, Asfaloth'', though he does not say them to his horse: he says them to Frodo. No actor is specified for this part.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:[[Decipher]] made two [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game|cards]] featuring extra [[Jarl Benzon]] as Glorfindel, one of them being at the Coronation of Elessar.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://scrapbook.theonering.net/scrapbook/movies/characters/other/view/12658|articlename=Glorfindel's Cameo in ROTK!|dated=|website=TORN|accessed=15 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070323204416/http://www.decipher.com/content/2004/04/040504lotrwetafalconer.html|articlename=The Making of the Weta \"Book Cards\": An Interview With Weta Workshop's Daniel Falconer|dated=5 April 2004|website=Decipher.com (archived)|accessed=15 October 2013}}</ref>  He is briefly seen in the film at Aragorn's coronation when Arwen is revealed.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Glorfindel played an important part in this video game, set during the [[War of the Ring]].

His design was changed to a more movie-accurate version in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. He serves as narrator throughout, and appears in the story itself after the death of [[Arvedui]].\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Glorfindel is featured in an extended flashback sequence depicting the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. During this time, he is the leader of the Bright Company, a group of [[High Elves]] who fighting to rid [[Middle-earth]] of [[Sauron]]'s evil long before that war and who continue their duty long after.\n:In the present day, Glorfindel can be found in Rivendell just south of the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]]. He is involved in the campaign against [[Angmar]] during the main story and also talks to the player after defeating the [[balrog]] Thaurlach. Glorfindel disappears in the final weeks of the [[War of the Ring]] and the player tracks him across Middle-Earth to summon him to the Council of Elf-Lords between [[Thranduil]], [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]].

He is portrayed with light tan hair (rather than yellow blond like Legolas), wears an outfit which is a mix of light blue robe parts and silver armour whilst wearing a light blue cape. He wields a bow of the Galadhrim and also carries a golden Elvish longsword (all Elvish longswords appear gold in the game).

He admired Faramir and saw him as a brave warrior and a great leader. Beregond did not travel outside of [[Minas Tirith]] often but understood the threat that [[Sauron]] posed to the city.<ref name=\"MT\">{{RK|MT}}</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\nOn the morning of [[9 March|March 9]]th, {{TA|3019}}, Beregond was assigned to help [[Peregrin Took]] who had just become a Guard of the Citadel. As Beregond had never met a [[Hobbits|hobbit]] before, he was eager to meet Pippin and he was astounded that Pippin looked much like a child yet had faced more dangers than most Men of Gondor.<ref name=\"MT\" />\n\n====Battle of Pelennor Fields====\n[[File:Maureval - The judgement on Beregond.jpg|thumb|left|Maureval - ''The judgement on Beregond'']]\nDuring the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]], Beregond was on watch as the sentinel at the gate of the Citadel. Pippin rushed to tell him that Denethor was attempting to burn Faramir alive. Beregond knew his duty of protecting Faramir was more important than to remain at his post so he rushed to his Captain at the [[Silent Street]]. The guard to the street would not let him pass and Beregond was forced to kill him so he could enter. He regretted his decision but he was forced to act quickly. Two more servants of Denethor's guard were killed as they attempted to light the funeral pyre. He stood upon the steps with his sword to ward off the rest until [[Gandalf]] arrived. After Faramir was rescued, Denethor would still not give up, and drew a knife to attempt to kill his son, but Beregond stepped forward to block Denethor. Denethor then gave up and set himself on fire and died.<ref name=\"Siege\">{{RK|Siege}}</ref>\n\nAfter helping to carry Faramir to the [[Houses of Healing]], Gandalf gave the key to the [[Fen Hollen|Closed Door]] to the injured Faramir. Beregond stood guard over Faramir at the Houses of Healing and was present when he awoke.<ref name=\"houses\">{{RK|Houses}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of the Morannon====\nPippin and Beregond served under the command of [[Imrahil]] at the [[Battle of the Morannon]]. When a Troll-chief charged their ranks, Beregond was stunned and nearly killed, but Pippin managed to save his friend by killing the Troll, which fell on top of him.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nUpon [[Aragorn]]'s coronation on [[1 May|May 1]]st, Beregond was brought forward to receive judgement for leaving his post and for killing Denethor's guards on hallowed ground. The penalty would have been death, but the King showed mercy as the deeds were done out of love for Faramir, and Beregond was merely dismissed from the Guard of the Citadel. For his bravery in battle, Aragorn appointed him the Captain of the Guard of Faramir, which was also called the White Company. He later went to live in [[Emyn Arnen]] in [[Ithilien]] to serve his lord, Faramir, the new [[Prince of Ithilien]].<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Beregond'' may stem from ''[[Beren#Etymology|beren]]'' meaning (\"bold\") and ''[[gond]]'' (\"stone\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> He was likely named after [[Beregond (Steward of Gondor)|the steward bearing the same name]].\n\n==Genealogy==\nBeregond was descended from people of the vales of the White Mountains and Ithilien.

They had divided into three kingdoms: [[Cardolan]], [[Rhudaur]] and [[Arthedain]], and were constantly at war with one another.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1039</ref> The Witch-king saw the North-kingdom of Arnor as more vulnerable than the South-kingdom of Gondor.<ref name=\"Malvegil\" /> He played upon their opposition, sending in infiltrators and taking over the hearts of the men of that land. By {{TA|1349|n}}, the government of Rhudaur was controlled by men secretly in his service,<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, entry for [[Malvegil]], pp. 193-194</ref> and he secretly aided them in their wars against the other kingdoms.<ref name=\"Argeleb\">{{PM|Elendil}}, entry for [[Argeleb I]], p. 194</ref> He then struck at a time of great hostility among the three, in {{TA|1409|n}}.

But [[Araphor]], the 18-year-old son of Arveleg, came to leadership and, with the help of the ancient elf [[Círdan]] of [[Lindon]], repelled the Witch-king’s forces at Fornost and the [[North Downs]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Araphor, p. 1040</ref> [[Elrond]] brought an army of [[Elves]] from [[Rivendell]] and [[Lothlórien]], and the Witch-king was pushed back and subdued.\n\n===Twilight of Angmar===\nThe Witch-king sat silent in Carn Dûm, rebuilding his armies and preparing for a final assault on [[Arthedain]], last of the Arnorian kingdoms. The [[Great Plague]] came and went in {{TA|1636|n}}, taking with it the last of the Dúnedain of [[Cardolan]]. The Witch-king sent [[barrow-wights]] to inhabit the barrows in [[Barrow-downs|Tyrn Gorthad]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Argeleb II, p. 1041</ref> In {{TA|1974|n}}, he felt that his power was sufficiently restored to begin the advance.\n\nHis attack was sudden, but not unexpected. King [[Arvedui]] sent a message to King [[Eärnil II]] of [[Gondor]] the year before, but help did not arrive in time. [[Fornost Erain]] fell, and the Witch-king took up residence there in the palace.<ref name=\"Eärnil\">{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1051</ref> Arvedui held out as best as he might on the [[North Downs]], but at last fled north with the treasured ''[[palantíri]]'' of [[Amon Sûl-stone|Amon Sûl]] and [[Annúminas-stone|Annúminas]]. He would not return, for he perished in a shipwreck in {{TA|1975|n}}. With him the ''palantíri'' were lost forever in the icy seas of [[Forod]]. The already-diminished North-kingdom ended, and [[Arnor]] fell.<ref name=\"Arvedui\">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arvedui and entry for Chieftain Aranarth, pp. 1041-3</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition in the south had formed. Eärnil sent his son, [[Eärnur]], north with a great fleet, all that Gondor could spare. They arrived at [[Lindon]] and joined with the folk of Círdan. Círdan summoned all that would come: surviving Dúnedain of Arnor and elves of Lindon.<ref name=\"Eärnil\" /> Even a company of [[Hobbits|hobbit]] archers went to their aide.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arvedui, p. 1042</ref> The Witch-king had grown overconfident and, instead of staying behind his fortifications, initiated the attack. The [[Battle of Fornost]] was fought on the plain between [[Nenuial]] and the North Downs. The Witch-king may not have anticipated the strength brought against him, but for whatever reason the alliance gained the upper hand. His army began to fall back toward Fornost, but Eärnur’s magnificent horsemen struck from the north and the Witch-king was routed.<ref name=\"Eärnil\" />\n\nHe decided to flee to Angmar and the safety of Carn Dûm, but the cavalry, with Eärnur himself in the lead, overtook him.  Moreover, the ranks of the allies swelled, as an army of elves from [[Rivendell]] came led by the mighty hero of old, [[Glorfindel]]. Angmar was purged of men and orcs, and all seemed lost for the Witch-king in the face of such numbers. But the Witch-king himself came at the last, robed and masked in black and riding a black horse, and attempted to kill Eärnur with his own hands. But Eärnur’s horse shied away and fled, and the Witch-king laughed. But Glorfindel came on his white horse, and faced with such power the Witch-king fled.  He vanished into the shadows and no-one marked where he had gone.<ref name=\"Eärnil\" />\n\nEärnur wanted to pursue, but Glorfindel held him back and made his famous prophecy.\n\n{{Blockquote|He will not return to this land.  Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.|Glorfindel, ''[[The Return of the King]]'', [[Appendix A]] (iv)}}\n\n===Lord of Minas Morgul===\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Witch-king.jpg|thumb|''The Witch-king'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nThe Witch-king escaped to [[Mordor]], and gathered the other Ringwraiths about him in {{TA|1980|n}}. Angmar and Carn Dûm were lost, and so in {{TA|2000|n}} the Ringwraiths began a [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|two-year siege]] of [[Minas Ithil]], eventually capturing the place and turning it into his residence. The wraiths sent an aura of fear in [[Gondor]], and much of [[Ithilien]] was deserted.<ref name=\"gondor\" />\n\nEärnur succeeded his father as King of Gondor, and still held the Witch-king in especial hostility due to his humiliation at the Battle of Fornost. [[Third Age 2043|The year]] of his coronation the Witch-king sent him a taunting challenge, but [[Mardil]] the [[steward]] restrained Eärnur from rash action. [[Third Age 2050|Seven years later]] the challenge was repeated, and Eärnur rode with a small escort to Minas Morgul; none ever returned, and there was no longer a King in Gondor.<ref name=\"gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nAfter this the Witch-king bided his time.  He and the Nazgûl built up their armies, including the terrible new orc-race of [[Uruks]]. In {{TA|2475|n}} he sent them out to capture [[Osgiliath]], which they did successfully.  They were driven out by [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] of [[Gondor]], who led campaigns to recapture Ithilien, but Osgiliath now lay completely in ruins and the region was left devastated and depopulated. Boromir was a great captain, and even the Witch-king feared him, but he was felled by a Morgul-wound and his rule was but twelve years.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Boromir, p. 1053</ref>\n\n===Hunt for the Ring===\nSauron declared himself openly in {{TA|2951|n}}, and sent three of his Ringwraiths to [[Dol Guldur]] (though the Witch-king was left in Minas Morgul). Then, by lucky chance, the creature [[Gollum]] was captured and interrogated. Under torture, the wretched creature revealed the tale of [[the One Ring]] and how it came to be in his possession.  But from his words, Sauron misunderstood that the land of the hobbits who stole the Ring was on the banks of the [[Gladden River]], whence Gollum originally came from.<ref name=\"thirteen\">{{UT|Hunt}}, p. 338-341</ref> Sauron sent the Nine, under the leadership of the Witch-king, invisible and uncloaked, to search for the Ring after the assault of Osgiliath.\n\n[[Khamûl]], the Witch-king’s lieutenant, reported that he was unable to find the “[[the Shire|Shire]]” in the vales of [[Anduin]].  The Witch-king was determined to search north and west until Gollum was found, or the Shire.  But plans were halted when Sauron received word of the events in Gondor and the doings of the turncoat [[Saruman]], and concluded that the Wise did not yet have possession of the Ring.  He sent the Ringwraiths to [[Isengard]] in the form of [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], and as they passed through Rohan their terror was so great that many fled the land, believing the Riders heralded an invasion. \n\nThey arrived at Isengard too late to prevent the escape of the captured wizard [[Gandalf]]; Saruman realized he had been revealed as a traitor to both sides due to his transparent lust for the Ring, and having no chance of deceiving Sauron any further, fortified himself in Isengard. The Witch-king did not have enough power with him to assault Saruman in his great fortress. He demanded the Wizard come forth, but received only the voice of Saruman. Nonetheless cunning and wary, Saruman convinced the Witch-king that Gandalf alone knew where the Shire and the Ring were, and so the Nine went out in search of him.<ref name=\"thirteen\" />\n\nThe Ringwraiths came upon the traitor called [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] and questioned him.  The terrified man told them everything he knew; that Gandalf had passed through Rohan, where the Shire was, and even that Saruman had lied to them.  The Witch-king spared Wormtongue’s life, foreseeing that Wormtongue would bring ruin to Saruman.  He divided his wraiths into four pairs, and went with the swiftest to [[Minhiriath]].  Along the way they captured several spies of Saruman, and found to their delight charts and maps of the Shire. They sent along the spy to [[Bree]], warning them that they now belonged to Mordor, not Saruman.<ref name=\"thirteen\" />\n[[File:Francesco Amadio - Amon Sul.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Amon Sul'' by [[:Category:Images by Francesco Amadio|Francesco Amadio]]]]\nThey came to [[Sarn Ford]], but the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] prevented them from crossing. The Rangers sent for their captain, [[Aragorn II]], as he was away, but defeating the Nazgûl was a task beyond the power of the Dúnedain, and may have been so even had Aragorn been present; the Ringwraiths attacked at night, capturing the ford and killing many of the Rangers. A few survivors fled northward to warn Aragorn of the wraiths' approach, but were pursued and slain or driven off into the wilds.<ref name=\"thirteen\" /> The Witch-king sent three Ringwraiths under Khamûl into the Shire while he went east with the others.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 22, p. 1091</ref> But they had come too late: the Ring had moved on in the hands of a hobbit, [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref name=\"Knife\">{{FR|Knife}}</ref>\n\n===Pursuit of the Ring===\nKhamûl was unsuccessful, but brought word from the spy they had spared in Bree. The man had witnessed a vanishing act on Frodo's part, and had organized an attack on the inn. The Witch-king assumed that Frodo would head east to [[Rivendell]], and sent four wraiths to [[Weathertop]],<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 164-6</ref> the ruins of the tower he had destroyed long ago. He went south along the [[Greenway]] and discovered nothing. Gandalf followed them, but the Witch-king let him slip ahead, and attacked him on Weathertop. Gandalf escaped at dawn, and again the Witch-king divided his force and sent four after the wizard while he and Khamûl remained near Weathertop to watch it.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 167-8</ref>\n\nThe chieftain of the Dúnedain, Aragorn II, had become the guide of the hobbits, and led them to Weathertop, where they were spotted and attacked by the Ringwraiths led by the Witch-king. The Witch-king advanced on Frodo, and the terrified hobbit put on the Ring, seeing the wraiths as they truly were. The Witch-king was taller than the others, with long hair and a crown set on his helm. When Frodo resisted the wraith's approach, and invoked the name of [[Varda|Elbereth]], the Witch-king stabbed Frodo in the shoulder.<ref name=\"Knife\" /> The tip of his [[Morgul-knife|blade]] broke off and remained in Frodo's shoulder.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, pp. 221-2</ref> Then Aragorn counterattacked with flaming brands.<ref name=\"Knife\" /> The Witch-king departed with the other Nazgûl, believing that his objective was completed.\n\nHe resumed the pursuit quickly, though,<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', pp. 180-1</ref> and found that Khamûl had been driven from the [[Last Bridge]] by his old enemy [[Glorfindel]]. The Witch-king, who only had one companion with him, was likewise unable to confront him openly.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 194</ref> They regrouped and went south, rejoining with the other four. They managed to pick up the trail of the company of the Ring, and despite hindrance from Glorfindel and Aragorn managed to pursue Frodo alone on [[Asfaloth]]. The pursuit came to the [[Ford of Bruinen]], and there Frodo compelled the horse to stop. The Witch-king saw his defiance and laughed, breaking his sword with a movement of his hand. But the waters of the [[Bruinen]] rose at [[Elrond]]'s command, sweeping the Nine downstream.<ref name=\"fourteen\">{{FR|Flight}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 195-6</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\n[[File:Angus McBride - Gandalf facing Witch-king.gif|thumb|''Gandalf facing the Witch-king'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]\nThe Witch-king took the only surviving horse back to [[Mordor]], arriving there in December. In addition, help was sent to the other eight Nazgûl when they were on their way back.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from a manuscript of The Hunt for the Ring, p. 262</ref>  In [[Minas Morgul]] they prepared for a grand invasion of [[Gondor]] at the order of their master.

The Witch-king rode at the head of the army clothed in black with a crown on his hooded head. As the Witch-king passed out of the gates of the dead city in the direction of Ithilien, he stopped, probably sensing the presence of [[the One Ring]], but he continued riding down the road after a while.<ref name=\"Stairs\" />\n\nThe army from Minas Morgul commanded by the Witch-king was reinforced by regiments of [[Haradrim]] outnumbered the forces of [[Faramir]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Denethor|Denethor II]]'s son, who defended the fords over the river [[Anduin]] at [[Osgiliath]] ten times and soon managed to cross the river in a large numbers of floats and barges, which they had secretly built on the eastern side of Osgiliath on the eastern side of the river. As a consequence, Faramir retreated with his men to the [[Causeway Forts]] at the [[Rammas Echor]].<ref name=\"Siege\">{{RK|Siege}}, p. 817</ref> The Rammas Echor was breached, and the [[Pelennor Fields]] were overrun. Other wraiths he sent out mounted on [[Fell beasts]]. Faramir was wounded by a dart and the [[Black Breath|black breath]], but his company was saved by a sortie. Then the Witch-king laid siege to [[Minas Tirith]] itself, sending fire and the heads of the dead Gondorians into the city via catapults. Then he launched the assault.\n\nHe sent [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] out first, accompanying it in person so as to be the first to enter the city.  Three times Grond struck the gate, empowered by the sorcery of the Witch-king. The third time the Gate shattered in a flash of fire. The Witch-king passed into Minas Tirith, but was confronted by Gandalf on [[Shadowfax]]. Gandalf forbade him entry, but the Witch-king laughed and put on a show of power.\n\n{{Blockquote|The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set.

Thus he departed, mounting a fell beast and descending upon King [[Théoden]] who led the attack.  [[Snowmane]], the King's horse, collapsed with a dart in the side, and Théoden was crushed beneath him.  But the rider [[Dernhelm]] defied the Witch-king.  The Witch-king threatened Dernhelm with a terrible death, but the rider revealed that she was a woman, [[Éowyn]], and the Witch-king remembered the words of Glorfindel. He hesitated, but then moved forward. Éowyn decapitated the fell beast, but the Witch-king rose and struck her down with his mace, breaking her shield-arm. Then the hobbit [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] stabbed him in the sinew of his leg with the [[Daggers of Westernesse|blade of Westernesse]] (though there was much pain in Meriadoc's arm afterwards), as he drew back to kill the woman.  Then Éowyn rose and drove her sword through where his invisible head was, and the sword broke as his crown toppled.  The Witch-king gave a great and horrible wail, perishing at last (in the [[Letters]] it is said he was “reduced to impotence”).<ref name=\"Pelennor\">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\nSo the prophecy of Glorfindel was fulfilled, for the Witch-king did not fall at the hands of a man, but that of [[Éowyn|a woman]]; and not by a [[Men|Man]] but [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|a Halfling]]. With his defeat, and the coming of Aragorn II in the black ships, the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] was lost by Sauron.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe Witch-king was originally introduced in the story as the \"Wizard King\" during the development of [[The Council of Elrond]] chapter.<ref>{{TI|VI}}, p. 116</ref> He continues to be referred to under that name in outlines<ref>{{WR|3|VI}}, p. 326</ref><ref>{{WR|3|VIII}}, p. 359</ref> and a manuscript for the chapter [[The Siege of Gondor]] where  Gandalf says that he is not only the captain of the [[Black Riders]], but a former member of his own [[Istari|order]] before \"evil took him\"<ref>{{WR|3|VI}}, p. 331</ref>.\n\nIn the early versions of the story, the \"Wizard King\" was planned to survive the Pelennor Fields battle and appear as the ambassador at the [[Black Gate]] instead of the [[Mouth of Sauron]].<ref>{{WR|3|VIII}}, pp. 361-362 and note 12, p. 364</ref> In early manuscripts the \"Wizard King\" even survived after [[Frodo]] has thrown the Ring in [[Sammath Naur]], blocking the door and saying: “Here we all end together”. At this point, either Sam appears at his back and stabs him from behind (with Sting?), or Frodo draws Sting, commands him to follow the Ring and drives him into the Fire.<ref>{{SD|1|Mordor}}, pp. 5-7</ref>\n\nIn the rare manuscript ''[[The Hunt for the Ring|The Hunt for the Ring: Time Scheme - Black Riders]]'', Tolkien speculates that the Witch-King might be afraid of Frodo, as he invoked [[Elbereth]] (a “name of terror for the Nazgûl”) and he could have slain the Barrow-wight.<ref name=\"RC\">{{HM|RC}}, \"Flight to the Ford\", p. 180</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nWhile in modern English ''witch'' has mostly female connotations, referring to a hag or sorceress, in middle-English \n''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(word) wicche]'' had no gender distinction; the preference of ''witch'' for female persons (the males referred more usually as ''wizzards'') evolved later through the centuries. Tolkien uses the archaic, gender-unspecific meaning of the term, which was \"a man who practises witchcraft or magic; a magician, sorcerer or wizard\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 21 citing from the 'Oxford English Dictionary'</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n*Witch-king of Angmar<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref> - \"Witch\" most likely coming from his background in sorcery, and \"king\" after his establishment of the realm of Angmar in 1300.\n*Witch-lord of Angmar<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}, p. 5</ref>\n*Sorcerer-King<ref name = \"Letter131\">{{L|131}}</ref>\n*Captain of the Black Riders<ref name = \"Letter131\"></ref>\n*Lord of the Nazgûl<ref>{{RK|Siege}}, p. 819 and p. 829</ref><ref>{{RK|Battle}}, pp. 839-40</ref>\n*Lord of the Ringwraiths<ref>{{RK|Tower}}, p. 900</ref><ref>{{RK|Shadow}}, p. 919</ref>\n*Chieftain of the Ringwraiths<ref>{{UT|Black}}</ref>\n*Lord of the Nine Riders<ref name=\"Stairs\">{{TT|Stairs}}, p. 706</ref>\n*King of the Nine Riders<ref>{{TT|Stairs}}, p. 708</ref>\n*Wraith-lord<ref name=\"Stairs\" />\n*Wraith-king<ref>{{TT|Stairs}}, p. 707</ref>\n*High Nazgûl<ref>{{TT|Choices}}, p. 738</ref>\n*King of Minas Morgul<ref name=\"Eärnur\">{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnur, p. 1052</ref>\n*Lord of Morgul<ref name=\"Eärnur\" />\n*Morgul-lord<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 220</ref>\n*Black Captain<ref>{{RK|Siege}}, p. 817 and p. 829</ref><ref>{{RK|Ride}}, p. 837</ref><ref>{{RK|Battle}}, p. 842</ref>\n*Captain of Despair<ref name=\"RK|Siege\" />\n*[[Dwimmerlaik]]<ref name=\"Eowyn\">{{RK|Battle}}, p. 841</ref>\n*Lord of carrion<ref name=\"Eowyn\" />\n*Number One<ref>{{RK|Shadow}}, p. 925</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nAn undead witch-king named ''Þráinn'' appears in ''[[:Wikipedia:Hrómundar saga Gripssonar|Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]''. It is possible that this was Tolkien's source of inspiration.{{fact}}\n\n<!-- I think that the Shapeskearean inspiration is told in Carpenter's biography -->\nThe prophecy that the Witch-king would fall \"not by the hand of man\" and the fulfillment of the prophecy occurring as a technicality (being slain by a hobbit and a woman) bears a striking resemblance to the prophecy regarding the title character's death in Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'', where it was foretold that Macbeth will be slain \"not by man born of woman\" and is then killed by Macduff, born by caesarian section. Tolkien was familiar with the play, having reputedly taken inspiration for the Last March of the Ents from the same source (See article ''[[Ents]]'' for details).\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations== \nThe Witch-king's true name is never given, and therefore among [[Tolkien fandom|Tolkien fans]], the Witch-king is often simply called ''Angmar'', after the name of the realm he founded and led. It is possible that he was one of the three [[Black Númenóreans]] Tolkien stated had become Nazgûl, or possibly [[Isilmo]], a Númenórean prince and father of Tar-Minastir. This possibility was adopted by the now defunct [[Middle-earth Role Playing]] game and [[Mithril Miniatures]] where he is named ''Er-Murazor'', a Númenórean prince and younger son of [[Tar-Ciryatan]].  \n===The Witch-king in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Return of the King (1980 film) - Witch-King.jpg|The Witch-king in [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Witch-king.jpg|The Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''\nFile:Witchking ea rotk.jpg|The Witch-king from [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings online Shadows of Angmar - Witch-king 1.jpg|The Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Witch-king of Angmar.png|The Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''\nFile:Guardians of Middle-earth - Witch King Icon.jpg|The Witch-king in ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]''\nFile:Shadow of War - The Witch King.png|The Witch-king in ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]''\n</gallery>\n\n===Films===\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:The Witch-king is shown with no distinction from the other [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]]; all are robed in brown and black, and none seem to be able to talk clearly.\n\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:The Witch-king is portrayed as a humanoid figure with no head. Red eyes glare under a golden crown. His dialogue is more or less as in the books, albeit in a strange and somewhat unfitting electronic voice. After a stab from behind by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Éowyn]] beheads him. It is worthy of note that the Witch-king is seen with the [[Red Eye]] of [[Barad-dûr]] as his emblem and faction, rather than the grim moon of [[Minas Morgul]].\n\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:The Witch-king is called the \"Witch-king of [[Angmar]]\", the \"Lord of the [[Nazgûl]]\", and the \"Greatest of the Nine\" by [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''; however, no other mention of the kingdom of Angmar itself is made. Also, in that film, there is no mention of [[Glorfindel]]'s prophecy; there is only a claim among the enemy that \"no man can kill\" the Witch-king.  Like the other Nazgûl, he is depicted as a humanoid figure shrouded in a hooded black robe; his only distinguishing feature is a mask-like spiked helmet with a huge mouth. His first mention is when Gandalf tells [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] while in Minas Tirith that the Dark Lord has not yet revealed his \"deadliest\" servant: the Witch-king, the one that \"stabbed [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] on [[Weathertop]]\".\n\n:During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], the Witch-king's army uses the ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] to break through the city gates early in the battle (after the failure of a lesser ram), and the Witch-king is not present to confront Gandalf as he is in the book. The confrontation takes place later, as Pippin and Gandalf race to the tombs to save [[Faramir]], and the Witch-king intercepts them. Unlike in the book, this meeting decisively favors the Witch-king, who breaks Gandalf's staff and throws the wizard to the ground before leaving to deal with the arrival of the [[Rohirrim]].  Gandalf's face shows obvious fear in this scene, in comparison to the resolution (for \"victory or death\") in the books.\n\n:The Witch-king's final stand on the battlefield occurs with less dialogue than in the book, and the weapons used to defeat him are both mundane: Merry's sword is not a [[Daggers of Westernesse|dagger]] from the [[Barrow-downs]], but rather the Rohirric sword that [[Théoden]] had as a child. This does makes it somewhat confusing in the film whether the Witch-King was truly destroyed in this fight (as he was in the book), or whether we was temporarily incapacitated (as at the ford of Bruinen) and later perished along with his fellow Nazgul due to the One Ring's destruction.\n\n:Eight actors are known to have played some part of the Witch-king.\n#An unidentified extra portrayed the \"King of Men\" in the prologue.

His [[wraith]], apparently summoned by the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]], is encountered by [[Radagast]] in the ruins of [[Dol Guldur]], but the [[Wizards|Wizard]] fends him off and salvages the Witch-king's [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]] in the struggle.\n\n:In the [[Attack on Dol Guldur]], The Witch-King, along with the other Nazgûl, participates by fighting [[Saruman]] and [[Elrond]], members of the [[White Council]]. In the end, he and the other Nine are driven back to [[Mordor]] by [[Galadriel]] and her [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]], [[Sauron|his master]] also eventually following suit.\n\n:No actor is known to have played the Witch-king in this film series.\n\n===Television===\n'''1993: ''[[Hobitit]]'':'''\n:The Witch-king is shown without distinction of the other Nazgûl. He was portrayed through computer-graphics.\n\n===Radio series===\n'''1956: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:The Black Captain is played by [[Felix Felton]].<ref name=\"RT1727\">Radio Times, Volume 133, No. 1727, [[14 December|December 14]], [[1956]]</ref>\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:The role of The Lord of the Nazgul, as he is always credited in this production, is expanded with material from ''[[The Hunt for the Ring]]''. He is the second speaking character in the series: he is the one who captures [[Gollum]], though he is not identified as such until the credits. [[Philip Voss]] provided the voice for The Lord of the Nazgul.\n\n'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''\n:The Witch-king of Angmar is played by Christian Mey.

The character is credited only as the Lord of the Nazgul, not by his Witch-king epithet.\n\n===Tabletop Games===\n'''1987: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]—[[Lords of Middle-earth: Vol. II]]''''' \n:[[Iron Crown Enterprises]] constructed an elaborate non-[[canon]]ical backstory for the Witch-king. In their interpretation, he was born during a solar eclipse in {{SA|1820}} in [[Andúnië]], leading to his mother naming him Tindomul ([[Quenya|Q.]] ''Twilight Son''). In [[Adûnaic]], his black hair led him to be called Er-Mûrazôr (''Black Prince''). As the second son of [[Tar-Ciryatan]] and younger brother to [[Tar-Atanamir|Atanamir]], he eventually grew jealous of his sibling. He sailed to Middle-earth in {{SA|1880}} with a small fleet, hoping to establish his own empire. He failed to establish a foothold in [[Lond Daer]], and journeyed southward to [[Umbar]], where he took control and proclaimed himself king. After only a few months, he was rebuked by his father and ordered to return to Númenor. Mûrazôr refused, but fled Umbar out of fear of his father’s wrath. \n\n:In Barad-dûr, Sauron took the prince under his wing in the first week of {{SA|1883}}. For 115 years he studied the Black Arts and became Sauron’s most trusted lieutenant. To reward his expertise, Sauron gave him a Ring of Power in {{SA|1998}}, after which he became known as the Witch-king and Lord of Morgul. During Sauron's capture by [[Ar-Pharazôn]], the Witch-king was in charge of Mordor, operating from the shadows to evade the eyes of Men. After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], he fought in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], but passed into the shadows when his master was defeated.\n\n:The Witch-king reappeared around {{TA|1050}}, joining his master in [[Dol Guldur]] where he remained for two and a half centuries, formulating a plan for the destruction of [[Arnor]]. In {{TA|1300}}, he flew to a high plain overlooking the northeast of Arnor, where he founded the kingdom of Angmar and established his cavern-fortress of Carn Dûm. In the following centuries he fought and subjugated the three successor kingdoms of Arnor, until his own realm fell to Gondor.\n\n:The Witch-king wore his father's Sea-helm, with a simple iron crown set into the crest, and had fashioned a suit of “Morgul Plate” armour with the same sort of Sea-drake skin. He wielded several weapons in addition to his [[Morgul-knife]]:<ref name=ICE>{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 98-102</ref>\n* ''Vasamacil'' ([[Quenya|Q.]] “Blade-eater”, [[Sindarin|S.]] ''Vasamegil''), a flaming [[Metals_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Ithilnaur|black ithilnaur]] broadsword, inlaid with ruby veins and its pommel topped with a ruby. It was forged in [[Thangorodrim]] by Sauron.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 48</ref>\n* ''Nallagurth'' (“Death's Proclaimer”), a [[Metals_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Eog|black eog]] mace inlaid with diamond veins, with an enchanted black tip.

It was likely a family heirloom.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 42</ref>\n===Video Games===\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:The Witch-king is shown without distinction of the other Nazgûl.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]'':'''\n:The Witch-king's role and voice are similar to that of the film, but his appearance is different. An early helmet design, that had been removed from the film because it resembled [[Sauron]]'s helm too much, was used here, presumably because there was no time to make a new character model.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Witch-King is one the main \"Hero\" units for the Servants of Sauron, his signature ability is being able to turn Wights into Nazgûl. The evil campaign storyline shows him reclaiming Dol Guldur for Sauron.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:Witch-King is a \"Hero\" unit for Mordor faction. He is an airborne unit riding on a Fell Beast and one of the strongest units in the game.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:In addition to his appearance from the first game, the Witch-King can now also dismount and become a landscape unit armed with a mace. An expansion was released for this game the same year, titled [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]. In this expansion, the campaign is centered around the Witch-King and his rise to power in Angmar.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Witch-king is a non-playable character present in several scenes. His most memorable appearance takes place in the Great Barrow within the Barrow-Downs. There are also multiple references to him in quest dialogue, the most notable is that the Witch-King for whatever reason cannot return to rule [[Carn Dum]] and instead has erected a Steward named [[Mordirith]] to rule in his place, in mockery of the Stewards of Gondor.\n\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''\n:In the campaign for the \"Evil\" side, the Witch-King is revived by other Nazgûl right before Sauron reclaims The One Ring.\n\n''''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:The Witch-king appears in a flashback of the playable characters during the prologue of the game. He and the other [[Nazgûl]] attack and destroy the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] camp at [[Sarn Ford]]. Shortly after he speaks with [[Agandaûr]], who explains that he has assembled an army in [[Fornost]]. The Witch-king commands him to return and attack immediately, to aid in the [[Hunt of the Ring]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>\n\n'''2012: ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:The Witch-King is a playable defender. He is equipped with a flail and specialises in controlling effects. His ''Death'' ability causes damage, reduces enemy healing and reanimates a fallen enemy to fight for him. ''Darkness'' forces an enemy to turn back and fight, preventing escape and reflecting damage. ''Malice''  causes Damage in area and improves his next attack. ''Despair''  slows a targeted Enemy and nearby Enemies.\n\n''''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''\n:The Witch-king is featured in the game. Voiced by Matthew Mercer, he serves as the main antagonist of the game. At the bidding of Sauron, he leads the siege on the city of Minas Ithil, making an adversary out of [[Talion]], in whom he takes a particular interest. Ensnaring General Castamir by promising the safety of his daughter, Idril, the Witch-king conquers the city for the Dark Lord. Using a [[palantír]] within Minas Ithil - now Minas Morgul - he sees that [[Celebrimbor]]'s New Ring is in [[Shelob]]'s hands. The Witch-king reveals what he has learned to his master, who rewards his allegiance with the reins of Minas Morgul and sends him to retrieve the New Ring.<ref>[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]], ''Prologue''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.zarkanya.net/Tolkien/origins_of_Nazgul.htm Origins of the Nazgûl and the Downfall of Númenor] by Alcuin\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=evil\n|house=[[Nazgûl]] of [[Sauron]]\n|born=Before {{SA|2251}}\n|died=[[15 March]], {{TA|3019}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=None\n|prev=Title established\n|list=King of [[Angmar]]\n|dates={{TA|1300}} - {{TA|1975|n}}\n|next=Title abolished\n|nvac=None\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Nazgûl]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Der Hexenkönig von Angmar]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/nazgul/roi-sorcier]]\n[[fi:Noitakuningas]]",

Her body was black and blotched with livid marks with a pale and luminous belly. She had bent legs with great knobbed joints that were located high above her back. Her legs had hairs that stuck out like steel spines and had a claw at each of their lower ends.<ref name=Body1/> Shelob also had a sting. Her skin was so thick that it could not be penetrated with the strength of a man, Elf or Dwarf, because it consisted of many layers of growth. It's still possible to make her impale or injure herself by making her apply her own weight on especially strong blades – a feat [[Sam]] accomplished with the sword [[Sting]]. Her eyes were the only softer spot, also very sensitive to light.<ref name=Body2/>\n\n== History == \nShelob was born as the last child of the spider-like being [[Ungoliant]],<ref name=Lair>{{TT|Lair}}, p. 723</ref> who had mated with and devoured other creatures of spider form in the valley of [[Nan Dungortheb]] in the mountains of [[Ered Gorgoroth]] in [[Beleriand]] in the [[Elder Days]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\nWhile dwelling in the Mountains of Terror, either Shelob or her kin fought [[Beren]] when he passed through to enter [[Doriath]].<ref name=Lair/>\n\nShelob fled from [[Beleriand|ruin]], and sometime during the [[Dark Years]], she came to [[Mordor]], though how she came to dwell there is unknown.

Shelob mated with her offspring which she slew, and her lesser broods spread from valley to valley from the [[Ephel Dúath]] to the [[Eastern hills]], [[Dol Guldur]], and [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=Lair/><ref name=guide/>\n\nAs the power of Sauron grew, people left the borders of Mordor and [[Minas Ithil]] was [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|conquered]] by the forces of [[Sauron]]. Elves and Men no longer came near to her lair and Shelob had to resort to hunt for [[Orcs]], which according to [[Gollum]], she considered to be poor food.<ref name=Lair/> Sauron knew that Shelob lived in her lair, but allowed her to dwell there, because she was an excellent guard of the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]] that led to Mordor and because he could spare the Orcs that she occasionally caught. He even sometimes had prisoners driven to her hole and ordered to report to him how she played with them and referred to her as ''his cat''.<ref>{{TT|Lair}}, p. 724</ref>\n\n[[File:Eytan Eylul Guler - Shelob and Sam.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Eytan Eylul Guler - ''Shelob and Sam'']]\n\nIn {{TA|2980}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, enty for the year 2980, p. 1090</ref> while looking for [[the One Ring]], [[Gollum]] encountered Shelob.

Lee had no dialogue, but hissed to convey Shelob's menace, then made a bubbling noise to suggest the passing of her poison into Frodo.  Finally, she made a roaring sound during her fight with Sam to convey her pain when Sam's thrusts found their mark. When the incident is described to [[Bilbo Baggins]], it is claimed that Shelob was killed.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]:'''\n:Shelob can be seen to have a retractable venomous sting at the rear end between the spinnerets, resembling a wasp's sting. This is very much unlike real spiders which inject venom with their fangs but accurate relative to the novel. Shelob also appears to have a gaping mouth, whereas real spiders can ingest only liquid. In the book, \"clusters\" of eyes are mentioned,<ref name=\"TT|Lair\"/> which may suggest compound eyes like those of insects; the Shelob in the movie does ''not'' have compound eyes.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]:'''\n:Shelob is a playable hero for the Goblins faction, and appears in the fifth level of the Evil Campaign, \"Mirkwood\", where she has apparently joined the [[Mouth of Sauron]] on his mission to take the [[Old Forest Road]]. During the level, Shelob can be used to recruit the Spiders of Mirkwood, as they are her children, and will obey her if she is sent to their nest. She also appears during the final mission, \"Rivendell\", alongside the other villains.\n\n'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''\n:Though unseen, Shelob is identified in the Appendices as the mother of the Ungol spiders that are encountered throughout Mordor. She is also referred to as the Spider Queen, a title that wasn't given to her in the book. An artefact, a \"Crushed Ungol Egg\", shows that Shelob initially lived in Mordor itself with Sauron and his servants, until it became apparent that Shelob would disobey Sauron, so he banished her to the pass of Cirith Ungol, and forbade her from laying any more eggs on his land. According to the \"Ungol\" article in the Appendices, Shelob has taken an interest in the recent events occurring in Mordor, though it is unclear to what extent. \n\n'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]:'''\n:Shelob is voiced by Pollyanna McIntosh, and plays a prominent role early in the game. This portrayal of Shelob is unique in that she is able to assume a fair form, as a raven-haired woman in a black dress. She can also project visions of the future into a person's mind. She ensnares the wraith of [[Celebrimbor]] and holds him prisoner at the start of the game. She releases him after Talion surrenders their newly-forged Ring of Power to her. After Minas Ithil is conquered by Sauron's forces, the Ringwraiths are sent to seize the Ring from her. After the Nine are driven away, she gives the Ring back to Talion and tells him to forge an army to conquer Mordor.\n: Reading her memories, which are found throughout Mordor, reveals a number of details of her life, including a romantic relationship she once had with Sauron.\n\n'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: Shelob is known to [[Elves]] as \"Ungwetári\" and Lord [[Celeborn]] had hunted her down in the early years of the [[Third Age]], to no avail. Shelob has a mental link to her children and after being stabbed by [[Samwise]] she summons all of her children to her side for nourishment and protection. Places formerly infested with [[spiders]] such as [[Mirkwood]] become empty as whole nests of them travel south to the call of their mother. Shelob herself is depicted as much larger than other giant spiders, which are encountered in the game on numerous occasions. Shelob herself is the last boss in the main raid of the [[Minas Morgul]] expansion.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Spiders]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Kankra]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/animaux/araignees/arachne]]\n[[fi:Lukitari]]",

Lurtz was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Lawrence Makoare]]. Though an original character, Lurtz inherits traits from [[Uglúk]], the leader of Isengard Uruk-hai in the book.\n\n==History==\nLurtz was the first of [[Saruman|Saruman's]] [[Uruk-hai]] to be bred, and led them into battle against the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] at [[Amon Hen]]. Lurtz also appeared to be the largest Uruk-hai, and his strength is highlighted when he strangles an Orc immediately after being spawned. In the book, [[Boromir]] is slain by an unnamed orc or orcs; he is described as having been \"pierced by many arrows\". In the film he is killed by Lurtz, who shot him three times. Before he could shoot a fourth arrow into Boromir, [[Aragorn]] intervened and a duel ensued. While Lurtz seemed to have the upper hand in the beginning due to his brute strength, he fell utterly short when it came to swordfighting; Aragorn quickly severed his opponent's sword arm and delivered a fatal thrust to the stomach. Lurtz tried to taunt Aragorn one last time, but was shortly after decapitated.\n\nAfter his death, leadership of the troop of Uruk-hai passed to [[Uglúk]], as was always the case in the books.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Lurtz\" may have been derived by [[Peter Jackson]] and his co-writers from the style of Tolkien's [[Orkish]] language, specifically the name [[Barad-dûr#Etymology|Lugbúrz]].\n\nLurtz's name is never spoken aloud in the film, and is only known from the franchise and credits.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn video games, Lurtz has been voiced by [[Isaac C. Singleton Jr.]].\n\nLurtz is one of the playable heroes of the Isengard Faction in ''[[EA's The Battle for Middle-earth Anthology]]''.\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]",

The average lifespan of an Orc is unknown, but it is conceivable that he was one of those sent to Moria by [[Sauron]] in about {{TA|2480}}.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> He had one son, Bolg, who succeeded him after his death.<ref name=\"Burst\" />\n\n[[File:Steamey - Azog and Nár.jpg|thumb|left|''Azog and Nár'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\n\nAzog entered history in the year {{TA|2790|n}} due to [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] Thrór's desire to revisit and perhaps refound the lost realm of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], in whose mighty ruins Azog dwelt.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> He entered the [[Great Gates]], but Azog and his orcs captured and slew him, and branded his hewn head with his own name, \"AZOG\". He flung the head at [[Nár]] who waited outside, then a money purse containing \"few coins of little worth\", warning that he would tolerate no future Dwarf beggars entering his domain at Moria.\n\nWhen news of this reached Thrór's heir [[Thráin]], he was greatly angered, and mustered a force of [[Dwarves]] to seek revenge on Azog. So the War of the Dwarves and Orcs began: the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] hunted Azog, and many battles were fought beneath the earth. After nine years of constant warfare, the climactic Battle of [[Dimrill Dale|Azanulbizar]] was fought before the gates of Moria itself in the year {{TA|2799|n}}.<ref name=\"TA\" />\n\nKing Thráin II and his son [[Thorin]] were in that battle, near the end of which, Azog emerged from the inner gate with his guards, Náin was exhausted and half blind with rage. He tried to swing as hard as he could, but Azog darted aside and Náin missed, splintering his mattocks on the ground. The orc kicked him in the leg when he dodged the Dwarf's blow, making him stumble, at which point Azog attempted to thrust and behead him, succeeding only in breaking Náin's neck because of the strong mail he was wearing. At this point, Azog noticed his retreating forces and retreated back inside.

He is a white-skinned Orc, known as the Pale Orc or Azog the Defiler. According to [[Balin]], he is from [[Gundabad]]. In the films, the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] appears in a flashback. [[Thrór]] is still alive at this time and is beheaded by Azog during the battle. [[Thorin]] fights with Azog and cuts off his left forearm, and the Pale Orc is dragged off by a few fellow [[Orcs]]. Thorin believes Azog to have died from his wounds, but, unlike in the book, he actually survived the battle and serves as Thorin's nemesis. The Pale Orc is also portrayed as a committed and trusted general of [[Sauron|the Necromancer]] - whereas in the source material his allegiance to the [[Dark Lord]] can only be assumed as a likelihood - and he is therefore tasked by his master first with hindering Oakenshield's quest and later with conquering the [[Erebor|Lonely Mountain]].\n\n:In the films, Azog speaks exclusively in [[Orkish]], whereas his literary counterpart was also known to use the [[Common Speech]]. He rides a gigantic [[Warg Matriarch|white warg]]. He also lacks the iron-clad head he featured in the books.\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:Azog leads a pack of Orcs on Wargs in hunting down [[Thorin and Company]] to wipe out the [[House of Durin|Line of Durin]] and to take his revenge on Thorin for his wound - even putting out a bounty on Thorin's head. In the film, it is his pack (not the Orcs of [[Goblin-town]]) that catch up to the Company on the other side of the [[Misty Mountains]]; after a brief fight with Thorin, he loses them when they are rescued by the [[Eagles]].\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n:While still in pursuit of Thorin and Company as they come down from the [[Carrock]] and make their way to [[Beorn]]'s house, he is summoned to [[Dol Guldur]] by the Necromancer himself. Though annoyed that yet again he is unable to track down Oakenshield, Azog submits to his master and agrees to lead his armies to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], sending his son Bolg to pursue the Company in his stead. He later leads an unsuccessful attack on [[Gandalf]] when the [[Wizards|Wizard]] enters the fortress prior to the army's departure.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:In this movie, Azog's appearance is changed, as he now wears plate armor, and he replaced his claw arm with one that looks similar to a sword. Azog is first seen marching on Erebor. When [[Bolg]] tells him of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elven]] Army, he orders him to Gundabad for more troops. From [[Ravenhill]], Azog commands the Orcs in the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Thorin, [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]] and [[Dwalin]] go to kill Azog, in order to leave the Orcs leaderless. But Azog captures Fíli and kills him in front of Thorin. Azog finally battles Thorin on a frozen lake and is knocked underwater. However, he breaks through the ice and stabs Thorin, mortally wounding him. Despite this, the Dwarf leader manages to stab Azog through the chest with [[Orcrist]] - finally killing the Pale Orc - shortly before succumbing to his own wounds.\n\n===Games===\n'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Azog appears in an extended flashback depicting the beginning and the end of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. Azog's youngest son \"Komog\" is slain in the halls of [[Gundabad]], while his eldest son \"Urro\" is killed by [[Thorin]] during the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in the same engagement that earns him the name \"Oakenshield\". [[Bolg]] survives as his only heir by escaping into [[Moria]] shortly before Azog is killed by Dáin.\n\n:In the present day, Azog's descendants continue to plague Durin's Folk. Bolg's son \"Mazog\", Lord of Moria, is the major antagonist of the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' expansions. Bolg's other son \"Gorgar the Ruthless\", Lord of Gundabad, is the chief antagonist of the ''War of Three Peaks'' expansion.\n\n{{references}}<br />\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| name=Azog\n| race=orc\n| house=\n| born=Before {{TA|2790}}\n| died={{TA|2799}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=Unknown\n| list=[[Orc]]-chieftain\n| dates=Unknown - {{TA|2799}}\n| next=[[Bolg]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{hobbitfilms}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Azog}}\n[[Category:Black Speech words]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:Orcs]]\n[[Category:Pronounced articles]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Azog]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/orques/azog]]\n[[fi:Azog]]",

Due to its location, it was called the '''Last Homely House''' from the point of view of a traveller going to the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Wilderland]]; and also the '''First Homely House''' from the point of view of someone coming from these lands to the civilised lands of Eriador to the west.\n\nIt was established by [[Elrond]] in {{SA|1697}} as a refuge from [[Sauron]] after the [[Sack of Eregion|Fall of Eregion]].<ref name=\"SA\">{{App|SA}}</ref> It remained Elrond's seat throughout the remainder of the Second Age and until the end of the Third Age, when he took the [[White Ship]] for [[Valinor]]. Rivendell had a strong alliance with the [[Kings of Arnor]] and after the fall of [[Arthedain]], it became a refuge for the [[Rangers of the North]] and the [[Heir of Isildur]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Soni Alcorn-Hender - Valley of Rivendell.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Valley of Rivendell'' by [[Soni Alcorn-Hender]]]]\nRivendell was located at the edge of a narrow gorge of the [[Bruinen|Bruinen River]],<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> but well hidden in the moorlands and foothills of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=\"Rest\">{{H|Rest}}</ref>\n\nPine-trees grew on the top of the valley, and there was a \"steep zig-zag path\" to the valley bottom. The vegetation in the valley bottom was mostly oak and beech.<ref name=\"Rest\" />\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\n====Foundation====\nDuring the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], and as [[Sauron]] was moving against Eriador, Elrond led an army of [[Elves of Lindon]] to the region. They arrived late but were joined by a detachment out of [[Eregion]] led by [[Celeborn]]. Despite this, Sauron's armies overwhelmed the Elves, and Elrond was unable to reach Eregion. Forced northward toward the headwaters of [[Bruinen]], Elrond established a stronghold.<ref name=\"SA\" />\n\nThis became a refuge for those seeking shelter from Sauron's onslaught in Eriador, and Elrond's and Celeborn's Elves were soon joined by many fleeing the [[Sack of Eregion]]. More came as Sauron ravaged Eriador on his march toward [[Lindon]]. By {{SA|1700}}, Sauron had overrun all of Eriador and Imladris was [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged]]. The siege ended when Gil-galad's forces, strengthened by the armament sent by [[Tar-Minastir]], routed Sauron's armies and drove him out of Eriador.\n\nA Council held at that time made Elrond Gil-galad's vice-regent in Eriador, and Imladris his seat. Gil-galad bestowed [[Vilya]] upon Elrond in secret. Aided by the power of the [[Three Rings|Elven ring]], Elrond made Imladris one of the chief seats of Elvish strength in the west in the latter part of the Second Age. Imladris remained an Elvish stronghold in Eriador to the end of the Second Age and into the Third.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>\n\n====Last Alliance====\nAt the end of the Second Age, [[Elendil]] and Gil-galad formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] to challenge Sauron, and their host halted for a while at Imladris in {{SA|3431}} and they stayed there for 3 years, gathered their forces before crossing the Misty Mountains.<ref name=\"SA\" /><ref name=\"SV\" /> \n\n[[Isildur]]'s wife and his youngest son, [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], were in Imladris at that time, and Isildur was journeying back to them after Sauron's defeat when he was ambushed at the [[Gladden Fields]].<ref>{{UT|7}}</ref> After receiving the shards of [[Narsil]], Valandil took up his role as King of [[Arnor]] and left Imladris for [[Annúminas]].<ref name=\"SV\">{{S|V}}</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\nAfter the fall of Gil-galad, Elrond remained in Imladris. During the Third Age, it was a refuge and sanctuary; many Elves gathered there, and it was the chief dwelling of the [[High Elves]] in Eriador, except the [[Elves of Lindon]], but also wise and powerful people of all the races. Most of the Elves who lived in Rivendell were High Elves.<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 64</ref> The [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]] were also harboured there due to their kinship with Elrond, as descendants of his brother [[Elros]].<ref name=\"SV\" />\n\nDanger came to Eriador around {{TA|1300}} when [[Angmar]] was established in the north-east beyond the [[Ettenmoors]]. It was late in the reign of [[Arveleg I]] that [[Second Siege of Imladris|Rivendell was besieged by Angmar]]. After an incursion by Angmar into Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the Elves of Rivendell joined [[Elves of Lindon|those of Lindon]] and the [[Galadhrim]], whom Elrond brought over the Mountains, in subduing the power of the [[Witch-king]] for many years.<ref name=\"eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the North-kingdom in {{TA|1975}} [[Aranarth]], the first [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], had [[Arahael|his son]] fostered in Rivendell, as were all subsequent sons of the chieftains.

One can find Elrond's library, the [[Hall of Fire]], the scholar's guild and various guest rooms.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Rivendell is one of the major cities in the game and the only place characters are obliged to visit more than once (other cities can be re-visited, but this is optional).\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Rivendell appears in the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|first film]] after [[Gandalf]] leads [[Thorin and Company]] away from [[Yazneg]] and the [[Wargs]]. Much of Rivendell is familiar from [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] but new areas have been included, such as the meeting place of the [[White Council]] and a crystal table used for investigating the [[Moon-letters]] in [[Thrór's Map]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{companyroute}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Elven realms]]\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[de:Bruchtal]]\n[[fi:Rivendell]]",

Too long I have dwelt upon this [[Hither Shore]]<br>And in a fading crown have twined the golden [[elanor]].|[[Galadriel's Song]]}}\n\n'''Lothlórien''' was a kingdom of [[Silvan Elves]] on the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]]. It was considered one of the most beautiful and \"elvish\" places in [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Third Age]], and had the only [[mallorn]]-trees east of the [[Belegaer|sea]].\n\n==History==\n===First settlers===\nThe first inhabitants of the forested area later known as Lórien were a group of [[Nandor]] that refused to cross the [[Hithaeglir]].<ref>{{UT|6a}}</ref> These Nandor scattered across the forests of Wilderland on both sides of the [[Anduin]].<ref name=POME>{{PM|XNotes}}, Note 67, p. 329</ref> The folk of Lórien were neighbours and kin to that of [[Eryn Galen]] on the east bank of the Anduin.<ref name=\"Sindarin\">{{UT|6b}}</ref> They named the forest that lay between the mountains and the Great River, above the [[Limlight]] and below the [[Gladden River|Gladden]],<ref name=geo>{{NM|P3xvii}}</ref> as ''Lindórinand'' in their [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan tongue]].<ref name=names>{{UT|Concerning}}, Note 5</ref>\n\n===Sindarin dynasty===\nFollowing the destruction of [[Beleriand]] and the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the [[First Age]], most of the [[Noldor]]in exiles and remnants of the Sindar retreated to [[Lindon]] and many refused the invitation of The [[Valar]]. One of the unwilling was [[Amdír]].<ref name=Sindarin /> He, along with his son [[Amroth]], established himself in [[Lórinand]], where he would soon lead the princeless [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name=\"AaN\">{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> The arrival of the Sinda [[Amdír]] affected the Nandor of Laurelindórenan. He took over as their King, while another Sinda, [[Oropher]], became King of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]. Their language was replaced by [[Sindarin]].<ref name=Sindarin />\n\n[[Celeborn]], a Sindarin elf, dwelt with his [[Noldor]]in wife [[Galadriel]] in [[Eregion]]. They made contact with the [[Galadhrim]] and before long they passed through [[Moria]] and arrived in the woods. Before the [[Sack of Eregion|Fall of Eregion]] and the death of [[Celebrimbor]], [[Nenya]], one of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves, was delivered to Galadriel.<ref name=Concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> Other survivors of [[Eregion]], including many [[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]], escaped into [[Khazad-dûm]] and were granted passage by their friends the [[Dwarves]], coming eventually through the [[Misty Mountains]] to the woodland.<ref name=\"Galadriel\">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>\n\nAs [[Sauron]]'s power grew over the [[Westlands]], King Amdír marshalled the Galadhrim to the [[War of the Last Alliance]] where many fell in the [[Dead Marshes]] along with their King.<ref name=Sindarin/>\n\nThe survivors, which included Amdír's son [[Amroth]], returned to Lórinand. Amroth was the new King, but he was tired of Middle-earth, and wished to go West and seek [[Valinor]]. When Moria fell to evil in {{TA|1981}}, many of the Galadhrim fled [[Edhellond|south]]. Amroth also departed with his beloved, [[Nimrodel (Elf-maid)|Nimrodel]], and they were never seen again.<ref name=\"AaN\"/>\n\n===Lord and Lady===\n[[Image:Angus McBride - Galadriel.gif|thumb|left|''Galadriel'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]\nAfter Amroth and Nimrodel had passed away, Celeborn and Galadriel took the title of [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim]].<ref name=Concerning/> With Nenya, the land was kept pure and alive, and evil was not permitted to penetrate it. They moved back to the western side of Anduin and built [[Caras Galadhon]], the great centre of the woodland kingdom. There Galadriel planted the seeds of the [[mallorn]] trees that were given to her by Gil-galad when she lived in [[Lindon]], where they couldn't grow.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> Because of the golden leaves of the mellyrn and the rule of the Lord and Lady, Lindórinand was given many new names, most famously ''Lothlórien''.<ref name=names /> Lothlórien was filled with light and life and became beautiful, and by the power of the Elven Ring the trees did not die.\n\nUnder the Lord and Lady, Lothlórien prospered for more than a thousand years as time passed without decay under the golden boughs. Celeborn and Galadriel produced a daughter, [[Celebrían]], who married [[Elrond]], and their granddaughter [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]] was considered the fairest of the elven race at that time.\n\nIn {{TA|3017}}, [[Aragorn]] passed by Lothlórien with the captured [[Gollum]] to deliver him to [[Mirkwood]]. [[Gandalf]] got word from Lothlórien on his way to the [[Shire]], and he changed his course to go and meet them.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\n[[File:Anna Kulisz - The Fellowship in Lothlorien.jpg|thumb|''The Fellowship in Lothlorien'' by [[:Category:Images by Anna Kulisz|Anna Kulisz]]]]\nBut as the [[Third Age]] came to an end, troubles at last began to touch the Valley of Singing Gold. As the shadow of [[Sauron]] lengthened and the [[War of the Ring]] raged, the border-wardens came across the remnant of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], a group of travellers on a [[Quest of the Ring|quest]] of immeasurable importance. Among the company were [[Aragorn]], a prince of the [[Dúnedain]] and a friend of the Lady, as well as [[Legolas]] of [[Mirkwood]]. The only reservation the border-wardens had about them was the dwarf, [[Gimli]].<ref name=loth>{{FR|II6}}</ref> The Fellowship were led blindfolded for a time, but at Galadriel's word their blindfolds were released and they were taken to Caras Galadhon on [[17 January]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}</ref> The very night the Fellowship arrived, a band of [[Orcs]] crossed the [[Nimrodel (river)|Nimrodel]]. A regiment or so of the [[Galadhrim]] were sent out, and destroyed the Orcs.<ref name=loth/>\n\nThere the Elves learned of the death of [[Gandalf]], and Galadriel knew what [[The One Ring|evil]] had been brought into the Golden Wood. She revealed her own ring to Frodo, and showed him her [[Mirror of Galadriel|mirror]].<ref>{{FR|II7}}</ref> Then the Fellowship was furnished with new supplies and sent off down Anduin, bearing the [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]] of the Lord and Lady.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>\n\nRight when the Company left, [[Gwaihir]] brought [[Gandalf]] to the Golden Wood, who was recovering from his battle with [[Durin's Bane]]. He was healed, clothed and given a new staff before leaving for [[Fangorn]].<ref>{{TT|White}}</ref>\n\nBut the coming of the [[One Ring]] was only the beginning of their troubles that were the heralds of greater conflicts that were to occur. [[Sauron]] unleashed [[assaults on Lothlórien|massive attacks]] on the Golden Wood.\n\nOn [[11 March]], forces from [[Dol Guldur]] swarmed into the forest in a full-scale assault. By the power of the Wood-elves and Galadriel’s ring, they were repulsed. The second wave came on [[15 March]], at the same time as the [[Battle under the trees|invasion of Mirkwood]]. Again, the enemies were forced out. The third and last attack was made seven days later, on [[22 March]]. They caused much destruction on the wood's borders, but the valiant Galadhrim routed them utterly. And after the [[Shadow]] of Sauron was lifted, they stormed [[Dol Guldur]] and cleansed [[Mirkwood]]; [[Thranduil]] gave its southern part into the dominion of Lothlórien, and it was called [[East Lórien]].<ref name=Great/>\n\nOn their way to [[Gondor]], [[Elrond]] and [[Arwen]] came to Lothlórien on [[20 May]].<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>\n\n===Afterward===\n[[File:War in Middle Earth - Lothlórien.png|thumb|right|Lothlórien in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'']]\nOnly two-and-a-half years after the War of the Ring, Galadriel, the Lady of Lórien, took ship West to Valinor.\n\nThe eastern border of Lothlórien in the southern [[Eryn Lasgalen]] became [[East Lórien]]. It was founded after the cleansing of [[Dol Guldur]] during the [[War of the Ring]], and [[Celeborn]] ruled the [[Galadhrim]] of Lothlórien. In the [[Fourth Age]], he grew weary and left for [[Rivendell]], leaving the wooded land of East Lórien populated by only a few wandering [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name=\"Great\"/>\n\nIn {{FoA|121}}, a grief-filled [[Arwen Undómiel]] travelled to Lothlórien, now fully abandoned, after [[Aragorn]] surrendered his life, surrendering her own life upon [[Cerin Amroth]]. \"[T]here is her green grave, until the world is changed, and all the days of her life are utterly forgotten...\"<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLothlórien stood between the south-eastern end of the Misty Mountains and the great river Anduin. The river Celebrant ran through the wood from its source in the mountains to the west through to the Anduin to the east.\n\nIn its earlier days, the woods of Lothlórien extended south into Fangorn Forest. In these days there was no true border between the two territories, though after conversation between [[Treebeard]] and the King of the Golden Wood it was agreed that the inhabitants of either land could walk freely at their leisure across whatever borders there may be.<ref name=\"Galadriel\"/> It is also possible that the woods of Lórien extended into the southern regions of Greenwood the Great, though there is only a small amount of evidence supporting this possibility.<ref name=\"Galadriel\"/> By the Third Age, Lórien was separate from Fangorn in the south and Mirkwood in the east by many miles.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Caras Galadhon]]\n*[[Cerin Amroth]]\n\n==Etymology==\n''Lothlórien'', said to mean \"Lórien of the Blossom\", is a compound of [[Sindarin]] ''[[loth]]'' + [[Quenya]] ''[[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]'' (\"?Dream Land\"). Treebeard translates the name as \"Dreamflower\".<ref name=HMRC>{{HM|UI}}, p. 300</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nLothlórien was often shortened to '''Lórien''', or the '''Golden Wood''' (referring to the golden [[mallorn]] trees that grew in that land).<ref name=HMRC/><ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 48</ref> Other names recorded for the region were:\n\n* ''Lindórinand'', ?[[Nandorin|N.]] \"Vale of the Land of the Singers\"<ref name=names />\n* ''[[Lórinand]]'', ?N. \"Valley of gold\"<ref name=names />\n* ''Laurenandë'', [[Quenya|Q.]] \"Valley of gold\"<ref name=names />\n* ''Glornan'', [[Sindarin|S.]] \"Valley of gold\"<ref name=names />\n* ''Nan Laur'', S. \"Valley of gold\"<ref name=names />\n* ''Laurelindórenan'', ''Laurelindórinan''<ref name=names>{{UT|Concerning}}, Note 5</ref> Q. \"Valley of Singing Gold\"\n* ''Dwimordene'', [[Old English]] \"Haunted valley\"<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Dwimordene\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Tolkien was unsure whether time of the outside world \"froze\" while the Fellowship stayed in Lórien, changing his mind twice; according to the first scheme the Fellowship had left Lórien and passed [[Sarn Gebir]] already on [[21 January]]. Eventually he decided that time passes normally, and had to adjust the dates and the routes of the characters, later changing their departure to [[14 February]] and eventually [[16 February]] (taking into account the full moon of [[7 March]]).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xlvi, xlvii</ref> In the published book, the characters instead have lost their subjective sense of time after leaving Lórien.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''\n:Lórien is one of the several battlegrounds in this game. The trees are just normal trees.\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Lórien was portrayed as a golden wood filled with sunshine during the day and Caras Galadhon as a city of moonshine and stary blue lanterns at night.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:After defeating the Balrog, the Fellowship enters Lothlórien. There are no missions; stepping towards a ladder triggers the [[Mirror of Galadriel]]-scene and continues the game.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:In the Good Campaign, Lothlórien (along with the Fellowship) is attacked by several waves of [[orcs]] and [[trolls]]. The area is full of treasures, which form the only income needed to make elven archers.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Lothlorien map.jpg|thumb|Map of Lothlórien from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.]]\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Similar to ''The Battle for Middle-earth'', a skirmish takes place after Fellowship's arrival in Lothlórien. Player's goal during the mission is to protect two mallorn trees from attacks for a certain period of time.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Lothlórien makes appearance as a Battleground in both \"Evil\" campaign and skirmish model. The layout of the map drastically differs from the ones in the game-predecessor.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Lothlórien is one of major regions of the game, added following the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria]]'' expansion. It is inhabited by over a hundred of non-playable characters, who are involved in hundreds of various quests. The map shows the major landmarks of the area: The [[Mirrormere]], rivers [[Anduin]], [[Nimrodel]] and [[Celebrant]], [[Cerin Amroth]] and [[Caras Galadhon]].\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Lothlórien is not part of the regular story mode, but becomes available as a challenge mission once the player clears Chapter 1 (Fornost). The player may earn experience by defeating waves after waves of enemies that invade the Golden Wood.\n\n'''2012: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''\n:Lothlórien appears both as a playable are on the map and as part of the Bonus Level that depicts all of Middle-Earth in small scale. Modelled on the film trilogy, it includes several quests as well as the characters Galadriel, Celeborn, Haldir and Lothlórien Elf.\n\n{{references}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lothlorien}}\n[[Category:Forests]]\n[[Category:Lothlórien| ]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Lothlórien]]\n[[fi:Lothlórien]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/forets/rhovanion/lothlorien]]",

Proud still and strong was that city, and in it the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] still flowered for a while before the house of the Kings.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]\"}}\n\n'''Minas Tirith''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] 'Tower of the Guard') was a city of [[Gondor]], originally called '''Minas Anor'''. From {{TA|1640}}<ref name=\"AppB-3A\"/> onwards it was the capital of the South-kingdom and the seat of its [[Kings of Gondor|Kings]] and ruling [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]].\n\n==History==\n===Minas Anor===\nThe city of Minas Tirith was originally a fortress, Minas Anor ([[Sindarin|S.]] 'Tower of the Sun'), which was probably built after the founding of the realm of Gondor in {{SA|3320}} before {{SA|3429}}.<ref name=\"AppB-2A\">{{App|SA}}</ref> It was the western counterpart to [[Minas Ithil]] ([[Sindarin|S.]] 'Tower of the Moon'): though was originally of less importance, and was built as a small fort on the summit of Amon Anor mostly to guard [[Rath Dínen]], the Tombs of the Kings.<ref>{{NM|P3xvii}}, Text 2, p. 365</ref> From Osgiliath the sons of [[Elendil]] jointly ruled the newly-founded [[Gondor|South-kingdom]], but Minas Anor was home to [[Anárion]]'s House and Minas Ithil to [[Isildur]]'s.<ref name=\"S-Rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref> Therefore when the seven ''[[palantíri]]'' were divided amongst the [[Realms in Exile]] one was placed in Minas Anor.<ref name=\"AppA\">{{App|A}}</ref><ref name=\"TT-Palantir\">{{TT|Palantir}}.</ref>\n\n[[Sauron]] attacked Gondor in {{SA|3429}}, [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|taking]] [[Minas Ithil]] and forcing Isildur to flee north to his father in [[Arnor]]. Anárion meanwhile was besieged in Osgiliath and Minas Anor,<ref name=\"AppB-2A\"/> until he was relieved by the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. In {{TA|2}} Isildur planted the second [[White Tree of Gondor]] in Minas Anor in memory of his brother, who had perished during the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]]. From this point the Kingship of Gondor belonged solely to the heirs of Anárion, who continued to rule from Osgiliath.<ref name=\"AppB-3A\">{{App|TA}}</ref><ref name=\"PM-Heirs\">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|420}}<ref name=\"AppB-3A\"/> Minas Anor was rebuilt by [[Ostoher]], the seventh [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]], and from his reign onwards the Kings removed there from Osgiliath in the summer.<ref name=\"AppA\"/> It remained the second city of Gondor for the next thousand years as the Kingdom reached the height of its power under the [[Ship-kings]], and then fell into its long decline. Osgiliath was burned and its ''palantír'' lost during the [[Kin-strife]], but the army of [[Castamir]] did not breach the walls of Minas Anor by force.<ref group=\"note\">When the Witch-king entered Minas Tirith, he rode \"under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed\", meaning that Castamir's army could not have breached the gate. However, given that Castamir reigned for ten years, it is likely that they ceded to him in some other way.</ref> Its people resented Castamir's rule and were angered by his cruel treatment of Osgiliath, and it is likely that they sided with the forces of [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] when he returned from the north in {{TA|1447}}.<ref name=\"Gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> After the defeat of Castamir, Minas Anor gradually grew more prominent.\n\nIn {{TA|1636}} Gondor was devastated by the [[Great Plague]], leaving Osgiliath depopulated and falling into ruin. [[Telemnar]] was killed along with his children and many others of the [[Dúnedain]], and the second White Tree died. Soon afterwards, his nephew [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]] permanently moved the [[King's House]] to Minas Anor and planted the third White Tree ({{TA|1640}}).<ref name=\"AppB-3A\" /><ref name=\"AppA\" />\n\nFor a short time under Tarandor and his heirs the decline of Gondor was slowed, although constant wars with various groups of [[Easterlings]] took their toll. In {{TA|1900}} [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] built the first [[Tower of Ecthelion|White Tower]] in the Citadel of Minas Anor to house the city's ''palantír''.<ref name=\"AppB-3A\"/> Just over a century later, however, the kingdom was dealt a harsh blow. In {{TA|2002}} Minas Ithil, where the guard on Mordor had long since slackened, was [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|captured]] by the [[Nazgûl]]. It became known as Minas Morgul, and in turn Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith, 'Tower of the Guard' or the 'Guarded City'.<ref name=\"RK-MinasTirith\"/> Soon after [[Eärnur]], the last King of Gondor, was killed in the Morgul Vale, and the lordship of the South-kingdom passed to the [[Stewards]].<ref name=\"AppA\"/>\n\n===Minas Tirith===\n[[File:Ray Minn - Minas Tirith over the Pelennor Fields.jpg|thumb|Minas Tirith over the Pelennor Fields by [[:Category:Images by Ray Minn|Ray Minn]]]]\nFollowing a brief respite in the [[Watchful Peace]], Gondor under the Stewards became increasingly beset by enemies: control of [[Ithilien]] and the ruined bridges of [[Osgiliath]] passed back and forth between Minas Tirith and Minas Morgul, the coastlands were raided by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], and Easterlings assailed them from the north.<ref name=\"AppA\"/> The Citadel was improved under [[Ecthelion I]] ({{TA|2685}}&ndash;{{TA|2698|n}}),<ref name=\"AppA\"/> who rebuilt the [[Tower of Ecthelion|White Tower]] which afterwards bore his name.<ref name=\"AppB-3A\"/> However, the third White Tree died at the same time as the twenty-first Steward, [[Belecthor II]], and this time a new seedling could not be found to replace it. The dead tree was left standing in the Citadel.<ref name=\"AppA\" />\n\nIn the reign of [[Ecthelion II]] ({{TA|2953}}&ndash;{{TA|2984}})<ref name=\"AppA\"/> Minas Tirith was strengthened against Mordor, where Sauron had now declared himself openly. It was at this time that [[Aragorn]] the future King first came to the city under the name [[Thorongil]], and did great deeds.<ref name=\"AppA\"/>\n\n===War of the Ring===\n{{main|Battle of the Pelennor Fields}}\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], the brunt of [[Mordor]]'s assault on the [[Free peoples]] was directed at Gondor and Minas Tirith. [[Cair Andros]] fell on [[10 March]] {{TA|3019}} and on [[12 March]] a company led by [[Faramir]] was forced to retreat from its defence of Osgiliath.<ref name=\"AppB-3A\"/> An effort was made to repair the Rammas Echor, but this came too late.<ref name=\"RK-MinasTirith\"/> With the crossings of Anduin taken the Pelennor was overrun, and Minas Tirith was besieged by a great army of Morgul orcs and Easterlings led by the [[Witch-king]]. The city was under-manned, and its defenders had little hope; on [[15 March]] the Great Gate was breached and the last ruling Steward, [[Denethor|Denethor II]], burned himself in despair.<ref name=\"RK-Siege\">{{RK|Siege}}</ref><ref name=\"RK-Pyre\">{{RK|Pyre}}</ref> But [[Gandalf]] was also present, and rescuing Faramir from his father he took charge of the defence of Minas Tirith. The [[Rohirrim]] under [[Théoden]] also came unlooked for to the city's aid, and [[Aragorn]] led a force up the river from [[Pelargir]]. Seeing this [[Imrahil]], [[Prince of Dol Amroth]], led a sally from the city, and the three armies were able to break the siege in the decisive [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref name=\"RK-Pelennor\">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\nOn [[1 May]] {{TA|3019}}, returning with the victorious from the [[Battle of the Morannon]], Aragorn was crowned on the plain outside Minas Tirith, and he entered the city as King Elessar. On [[25 June]] he discovered a sapling of the line of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]] in a hidden hallow of Mount Mindolluin. This was planted in the Court of the Fountain &ndash; the fourth White Tree of Gondor.<ref name=\"AppB-3A\"/><ref name=\"RK-StewardKing\">{{RK|Steward}}.</ref>\n\n===Fourth Age===\nUnder King Elessar, Minas Tirith was restored and made more beautiful than ever before: the Great Gate was reforged of ''[[mithril]]'' and steel by the [[Dwarves]] of the [[Glittering Caves]],<ref>{{App|Durin}}, p. 1080</ref> led by [[Gimli]], the streets were paved with white marble and the city was filled with trees and fountains. Dwarves came to work in the city and [[Elves]] enjoyed coming to it.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}, p. 968</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:J.R.R. Tolkien - Minas Tirith.jpg|left|thumb|\"Minas Tirith\" (unfinished drawing) by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nAt some point in the past, the city was considered to be part of the region of [[Anórien]] but was considered separate by the time of the War of the Ring.<ref name=Nomen>{{HM|N}}, entry Sunlending, p. 776</ref>\n\nThe city was situated on the [[Hill of Guard]] &ndash; the \"out-thrust knee\" of [[Mount Mindolluin]], connected to the main mass of the mountain by a narrow 'shoulder'.<ref name=\"RK-MinasTirith\">{{RK|MT}}.</ref><ref name=\"WR-MinasTirith\">{{WR|3|III}}.</ref> It faced eastward towards Osgiliath, over the [[Pelennor Fields]] surrounding the city, fertile townlands stretching from the walls of the city proper to the [[Rammas Echor]].<ref name=\"RK-MinasTirith\"/>\n\nThe city was built on the hill with seven concentric tiers cut on the hill culminating in the [[Citadel of Gondor|Citadel]] at the summit, 700 feet above the plain below. The outer wall was called the [[City Wall]] and was black, of the same material used in [[Orthanc]]. The City Wall was vulnerable only to earthquakes capable of rending the ground where it stood.<ref name=\"RK-MinasTirith\"/>\n\nEach level was walled and held a gate with each gate faced a different direction: only the great gate and that of the seventh level faced east; the gate to the second level faced southeast, and that to the third faced northeast; so altering between the two such that the path up through the levels wound to and fro rather than following a straight line. An outcropping of rock as high as the seventh level bisected all the lower levels except the lowest on the line of the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|Great Gate]]. The winding path through the city therefore passed through tunnels in this 'keel' five times. \n\nThe '''First Level''' included the [[Rath Celerdain]], a white paved street with an inn, the [[Old Guesthouse]].\n\nThe '''Sixth Level''' contained stables for riders, and the [[Houses of Healing]]. There was also [[Fen Hollen]], a door which was almost always closed, leading to [[Rath Dínen]],<ref name=\"RK-MinasTirith\" /> the 'shoulder' of rock that joined the Hill to the main mass of Mount Mindolluin rose to the level of the fifth wall and was fortified with large ramparts, where the tombs of the Kings of Gondor and their Stewards lay. The uppermost tunnel was delved into the spur of rock that jutted out of the eastern face of the Hill; The keystone of its archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. [[Guards of the Citadel]] manned the Seventh Gate which faced eastward in line with the Great Gate 700 feet below and emerged into the Citadel, the city's strongest point, surrounded by high walls and battlements on the 'keel'. \n\nThe '''Citadel''' housed the [[Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith)|Court of the Fountain]] and the [[Tower of Ecthelion]], which brought the total height of the city to 1000 feet.<ref group=\"note\">On the basis of this figure and unpublished sketches by Tolkien [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] estimated the breadth of the city at 3100 feet in her ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth|Atlas]]''.</ref> Before the Tower grew the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] in a court. There were also the [[King's House]], lodgings for the Steward, [[Merethrond]], barracks for the Guard of the Citadel, and other buildings for guests and other workers.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Minas Tirith'' is a [[Sindarin]] name,<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, entry S ''Minas Tirith'', p. 31</ref> which means \"Tower of Guard\"<ref name=Guard/> or \"Tower of Watch\".<ref name=PE17/> Paul Strack suggests that the name is a combination of ''[[minas]]'' (\"tower\", \"fort\", \"city\") and ''[[tirith]]'' (\"watch\", \"ward\", \"guard\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-538283653.html|articlename=S.

''Gemen'' means \"care\", \"heed\" or \"watch\". ''Heatorras'' means \"high towers\" and ''Mundbeorg'' means \"protection-hill\".<ref>{{TI|King}}, Notes, note 7, p. 449</ref> The Old English variants ''berg'' and ''beorg'' mean \"hill\" or \"mountain\".<ref>{{WR|3|VII}}, Notes, note 9, p. 356</ref>\n\nOn an unfinished sketch, Tolkien has written the names ''Stanburg'' ([[Old English]]) and ''Steinborg'' ([[Old Norse]]) both meaning \"Stone City\".<ref>{{HM|PT}}, #27</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nMinas Tirith's most obvious historical parallel is the capital of the Byzantine Empire, Byzantium or Constantinople. Founded by the Roman emperor Constantine, Constantinople would eventually be one of the largest cities of its day and be a fortress under constant attack by its enemies. Similarly, Minas Tirith would become the chief fortification of Gondor in the latter days of its decline.\n\nLike Minas Tirith, the Byzantine capital Constantinople sat near a strategic waterway (the Anduin to the Bay of Tolfalas in the case of Minas Tirith, the Bosporus Strait which divides the Mediterranean and Black Seas in the case of Constantinople) and was protected by massive walls that were virtually impregnable until the rise of effective gunpowder weapons in the real-world 15th century.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 570</ref>\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] summarized the story of ''The Silmarillion'' and of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in a long [[letter to Milton Waldman]], that was probably written in late 1951.<ref name=\"L131\">{{L|131}}</ref> In this letter he stated that in the Third Age Gondor rises to a peak of power and then \"fades slowly to decayed Middle-Age, a kind of proud, venerable, but increasingly impotent Byzantium\"<ref name=\"L131\"/> and that the story in Book Five of '' The Lord of the Rings'' comes to the \"half-ruinous Byzantine City of Minas Tirith\"<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 746</ref>.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Minas Tirith in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Return of the King (1980 film) - Minas Tirith.png|Minas Tirith in [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]\nFile:War in Middle Earth - Minas Tirith.gif|Minas Tirith in ''[[J.R.R.

Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''\n:Minas Tirith is one of the many battlefields in this game. The city is brown, unlike the books in which it is white. \n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:The city appears briefly when Gandalf goes there to discern the identity of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s [[The One Ring|One Ring]].\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:Minas Tirith can be seen in the distance for a few seconds when [[Faramir]] takes [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Gollum]] to [[Osgiliath]].\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:Tolkien's description of the physical layout of Minas Tirith is mostly adhered to in the film, although certain artistic liberties are taken, such as the Tower of Ecthelion being separate from the building which contains the throne room. Despite the description of Minas Tirith's [[Othram]] as a black, indestructible wall, Jackson depicted all of the walls as white, which crumble quickly under attack from Mordor's catapults. The city is also closer to the mountain than in Tolkien's description and sketches. In the film, the city is within clear sight of the mountains surrounding Mordor and the fires of [[Mount Doom]] - so much so, that in at least one night scene the light of Minas Morgul shines on the faces of viewers from the city walls.  However, in the books, the mountains were far enough away that from the city they looked like a low dark shadow over the land far away.\n\n:According to the \"Making Of\" featurettes on the Extended Edition DVDs, the appearance and structure of the city was based upon [[Wikipedia:Mont Saint-Michel|Mont Saint-Michel]], France.\n\n:Portions of Minas Tirith were constructed as full-scale sets (built on the foundations of the disassembled [[Helm's Deep]] set), and the whole city as a highly detailed \"[[bigature]]\" by [[Weta Workshop]] combined with a detailed three-dimensional digital model, along with the whole of its surrounding environment. \n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: Several different versions of the city exist in-game, separated chronologically: under the [[Dawnless Day]], during the [[Siege of Gondor]], after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] and during the Great Wedding of [[Aragorn]] and [[Arwen]] at [[Mid-year's Day]]. Each version is explorable and has a different set of quests. The Seven Tiers of the city have been given names: Worker's Tier, Soldier's Tier, Craftsmen's Tier, Player's Tier, Sages' Tier, Master's Tier and the Citadel. Large statues of every past King and Ruling Steward are placed across the city.\n\n{{references|note}}\n\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n\n[[Category:Minas Tirith]]\n\n[[de:Minas Tirith (Gondor)]]\n[[fi:Minas Tirith]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/gondor/minas tirith]]",

In T.A. 2569, Brego built [[Meduseld]], the Golden Hall.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2569, p. 1087</ref> on the top of the hill on which Edoras was built.  \n\n[[Wulf]] son of [[Freca]] the [[Dunlendings|Dunlending]], invaded Rohan in {{TA|2758}} and took Edoras, usurping the throne in Meduseld.  But the [[Long Winter]], which had lasted five long months, ended and [[Fréaláf]] son of [[Hild]] came out of [[Dunharrow]] and with a small band of men, surprising Wulf, he attacked '''Edoras''' and slew Wulf, regaining the city.\n\nIt was here that [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gandalf]] the White met with [[Théoden]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe city was built on a hill in [[Harrowdale]], a valley of the [[White Mountains]] which lay under the great mountain [[Starkhorn]]. The river [[Snowbourn]] flowed past Edoras on its way west towards the [[Entwash]].\n\nEdoras was encircled by a wall, with a dike dug around the hill. It had a spring whose water flowed in a channel along the main road.\n\nOutside, there was the [[Barrowfield]], with the tombs of the [[Kings of Rohan|Rulers of Rohan]] arrayed in two rows by the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Simbelmynë]] grew there. Through the two rows of the [[Barrowfield]], a rutted road led from the city gates passed the [[Snowbourn]].<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.06.000}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Edoras'' is said to mean \"the courts\" in the Mark-speech of Rohan.<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Edoras'', p. 247</ref>\n\nIn [[Old English]], ''edoras'' (plural of ''[[Wiktionary:eodor|edor, eodor]]'') means \"dwellings, houses\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 247</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Edoras.jpg|thumb|Edoras in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]'''\n:Edoras is featured in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|second]] and the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third]] film. It was built on [[Mount Sunday]].\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'''''\n:Unlike many in-game settlements much smaller in size and prominence, Edoras is not considered a \"capital\" of its region. This is because early in the story Edoras is evacuated, with all inhabitants moving to [[Dunharrow]], and for the majority of the game Edoras sits empty. Instead, [[Aldburg]] functions as the \"capital settlement\" of the Western Rohan, hosting the hub for swift travel and various player facilities.\n\n{{References}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[de:Edoras]]\n[[fi:Edoras]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:rohan:edoras]]",

In the centre of the [[Ring of Isengard]] stood the stone tower of [[Orthanc]].<ref name=\"FRCouncil\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe fortress of Isengard was located in a valley at the southern tip of the [[Misty Mountains]]; the [[Ring of Isengard]] was a great wall of stone that ran out from the mountain-side and then back again. The only entrance to Isengard was found delved into the southern wall of Isengard. One entering Isengard would pass through its only gate, travel down the long tunnel and pass through the iron doors to come to the plain of Isengard. In the centre of the plain, half a mile from the gate, stood the looming tower of [[Orthanc]]. For most of its history the lands of Isengard were green and a river ran from the mountains to form a lake. However after the treason of Saruman all green things that grew were removed and the river was dammed. The inner-ring was riddled with houses which cut into the walls. About the plain great shafts had been dug deep and many stone-flags paved the roads of the surface.<ref name=\"TTFlotsam\"/><ref name=\"TTRoad\">{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. One entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim.|''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Road to Isengard]]\"}}\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\n[[File:Rob Alexander - Isengard.jpg|thumb|''Isengard'' by [[Rob Alexander]]]]\nIt is unknown exactly when Isengard was first established. However it must have been built between {{SA|3320}}, the year in which the realms of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] were established, and {{SA|3430}}, the year in which the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] was formed to resist [[Sauron]]'s tyranny.<ref>{{App|B1}}</ref> The [[Ring of Isengard]], and the tower of [[Orthanc]] therein, were built by the [[Dúnedain]], the Exiles of [[Númenor]], as a fortress on the north-western tip of Gondor. Within Orthanc was placed one of the seven seeing stones, the ''[[palantíri]]''.<ref name=\"SV\"/> This stone would hence be referred to as the [[Orthanc-stone]].<ref name=\"TTP\">{{TT|Palantir}}</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\n[[Calenardhon]], a region never densely populated, suffered greatly at the hands of the {{TA|1636}} [[Great Plague]]. [[Orthanc]] was thus closed and its keys were sent to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\"UTP\">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> The fortress of Isengard, however, remained manned by a small garrison led by a hereditary Gondorian chieftain. This company grew more secretive as time progressed; its chieftain became known as the \"[[Lord of Isengard]]\" and they were believed to meddle in dark [[magic]] by the [[Rohirrim]].<ref name=\"UTIsen\"/>\n\nThe attention of the [[Stewards of Gondor]] eventually turned eastwards and their emissaries to Isengard eventually ceased completely. In their neglect they  did not realise that the line of Gondorian chieftains had failed. The people had long intermingled with the [[Dunlendings]], enemies of the Rohirrim, and became more friendly to them than to the 'wild Northmen'. [[Hill-men]] of [[Dunland]] were allowed to settle in and around Isengard. They seized control of the fortress and slew any of the ancient Isengard guards who were unwilling to merge with them. During the reign of [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Déor]] they became openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Déor could not besiege Isengard and [[Egalmoth]], the Steward of Gondor, was unable to send help. Instead Déor kept a strong force of riders in the north of the [[Westfold]].<ref name=\"UTIsen\"/> The occupation lasted through the reign of King [[Gram]].<ref name=\"AppA2\"/>\n\nAt the time of King [[Helm]]'s reign in {{TA|2758}}, the exiled lord [[Wulf]] led the Dundlendings into a great invasion of Rohan. Despite impressive victories, they were eventually defeated by the Rohirrim. The Dunlendings who occupied Isengard suffered considerably in the [[Long Winter]]. They capitulated and were driven out by Helm's nephew, [[Fréaláf]] (soon to be the new King of Rohan) near the end of {{TA|2759}}.<ref name=\"UTIsen\"/><ref name=\"AppA2\">{{App|A2}}</ref>\n\n====Saruman's domain====\nWhen the [[Istari|Wizard]] [[Saruman]] returned from his travels into the east of [[Middle-earth]], he offered to make Isengard his home and to lend his help  in defending the West. As both Gondor and Rohan suffered from the Long Winter and wars, the Wizard Saruman was welcomed by King Fréaláf and Steward [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] alike with open arms. In {{TA|2759}},<ref name=\"AppStewards\">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> The valley in which Isengard resided soon became known as \"[[Nan Curunír]]\", the \"Valley of Saruman\" or the \"Wizard's Vale\".<ref name=\"TTTreebeard\">{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref><ref name=\"TTRoad\">{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2953}},<ref group=\"note\">''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry \"Isengard\" incorrectly gives the date {{TA|2963}}.</ref> following the last meeting of the [[White Council]], the Wizard took Isengard for his own as [[Lord of Isengard]], and fortified it.<ref name=\"AppStewards\"/><ref name=\"AppTA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> Around {{TA| 2990}}, [[Orcs]] began mustering and breeding in muddy pits tunneled within the ringed walls.<ref name=\"UTP\"/> With the corrupted Wizard suborned by the [[Dark Lord]] through the ''[[palantír]]'',<ref name=\"AppTA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> Isengard became a nominal fiefdom of [[Mordor]], as Saruman wished to share in Sauron's power by either aiding his victory or retrieving the [[One Ring]] first.<ref name=\"FRCouncil\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nOn [[10 July]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf arrived at Isengard, having been summoned there by Saruman.<ref name=\"AppGreat\">{{App|Great}}</ref> The corrupted Wizard revealed his true colours and demanded that the Grey Pilgrim submit to him or to the Dark Lord. Gandalf refused both choices and was imprisoned atop [[Orthanc]]. From the pinnacle of the tower Gandalf could see that Isengard had been transformed; in place of trees and grass were pits and forges, and Saruman was assembling  [[Orcs of Isengard|his Orcs]] and [[Wolves]] into an army both in service and in rivalry of Sauron.<ref name=\"FRCouncil\">{{FR|Council}}</ref> On [[18 September]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf was borne away by [[Gwaihir]] the [[eagles|eagle]].<ref name=\"AppGreat\"/>\n\nBelieving that Saruman knew the location of the One Ring, Sauron sent the [[Nazgûl]] to Isengard. The [[Witch-king]] arrived at the gate of Isengard two days after Gandalf's escape (or, according to a different account, on the very day of his escape). But the Lord of [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]] and his company did not have the strength to assault Isengard. The Nazgûl departed after Saruman told them that he believed Gandalf knew the whereabouts of the Ring and suggested they seek him out.<ref name=\"UTHunt\">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>\n\nIsengard became Saruman's base of operations during the [[War of the Ring]]. His war with [[Rohan]] began on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}}, with the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. The forces of Isengard were victorious and the Wizard Saruman's main objective, the killing of Prince [[Théodred]] (son of King [[Théoden]]), was achieved. With another victory at the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] on [[2 March]], the legions of Isengard won passage into the plains of Rohan and marched onwards to [[Helm's Deep]], suffering utter defeat in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] (on [[3 March]]).<ref name=\"UTIsen\"/><ref name=\"AppGreat\"/>\n\n[[File:Jef Murray - After the Flood.jpg|thumb|[[Jef Murray]] - ''After the Flood'']]\n{{Blockquote|My business is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.|[[Treebeard]]<ref name=\"TTFlotsam\"/>}}\n\nOn 2 March, the [[Battle of Isengard]] began when the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] began their attack on the unprotected Isengard.<ref name=\"AppGreat\"/> They overran the Orcs and vile Men therein, but were unable to assail the tower of Orthanc.<ref name=\"TTFlotsam\"/>\n\nOn [[5 March]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], now the \"doorwardens\" of Isengard, welcomed [[Théoden]], [[Éomer]], [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]].<ref name=\"TTRoad\"/> They parleyed with Saruman, but he refused to co-operate and was so left locked in Orthanc until the defeat of his master, Sauron.<ref name=\"TTVoice\">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>\n\nOn [[22 August]], {{TA|3019}},<ref name=\"AppB3\">{{App|B3}}</ref> Treebeard, now in charge of what remained of the ringed fortress,<ref name=\"TTRoad\"/> allowed Saruman and [[Gríma]] to depart from Isengard. Before they went, they handed over the keys of Orthanc. This Treebeard told to Gandalf and company when they travelled through Isengard on their journey home.<ref name=\"RKPartings\">{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\n====Treegarth and the Fourth Age====\n{{main|Treegarth of Orthanc}}\nFollowing the Battle of Isengard in which the [[Ring of Isengard]] was destroyed, the Ents filled the land with gardens of orchards and trees. A stream ran into a small clear lake, in the middle of which stood the black-stone tower of Orthanc. Whilst the Treegarth of Orthanc became part of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] granted the Ents complete self-governance of what was formerly Isengard.<ref name=\"RKPartings\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Isengard'' means \"Iron-enclosure\" in [[Old English]] (see also [[Isen]]): \"''It was so called because of the great hardness of the stone in that place and especially in the central tower of Orthanc.''\"<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 772</ref>\n\n''Isen'' is a variant form of Old English ''iren'' 'iron.' 'Gard' is a modernization of Old English ''geard'' meaning 'enclosure,' which occurs in Old English ''Middangeard'', the equivalent of Old Norse ''Midgard'', both of which mean the world of Men. Through misunderstanding, ''Middangeard'' became ''Middanerd'' > 'Middle-earth.' The name ''Isengard'' represents a [[Westron]] translation of [[Sindarin]] ''Angrenost''.<ref name=\"Nomen\"/>\n\n'''''Angrenost''''' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Iron Fortress\",<ref name=\"SIndex\">{{S|Index}}, entry \"Angrenost\"</ref> from ''[[anga|angren]]'' (\"of iron\") + ''[[ost]]'' (\"fort, stronghold, enclosure\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[anga]]'', ''[[ost]]''</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Isengard in Adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:War in Middle Earth - Orcs and Uruk-hai at Isengard.png| Isengard in ''[[J.R.R.

During most of the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s it was ruled by [[Sauron]] and it was his dwelling and base from which he attempted to conquer [[Middle-earth]].\n\nMordor was surrounded by three enormous mountain ridges from the North, from the West and from the South, protecting it from an unexpected invasion by any of the [[Free peoples]].\n\nOnly a few times in history did the free peoples have anything to do with Mordor; the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] broke into the land to fight Sauron, and millennia later [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] infiltrated that land to destroy [[the One Ring]]. \n\n==Geography==\nMordor was protected from three sides by mountain ranges, arranged roughly rectangularly: the [[Ered Lithui]] in the north, and the [[Ephel Dúath]] in the west until they turned to the east, forming a southern range.<ref name=\"FRMap\">{{FR|Map}}</ref> The [[Morgul Pass]] led from the [[Morgul Vale]] in [[Ithilien]], which was guarded by the city of [[Minas Morgul]] (earlier [[Minas Ithil]]) through the Ephel Dúath into Mordor; [[Cirith Ungol]], a higher more difficult pass was guarded by the giant spider [[Shelob]] and by the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. Another known fortress was [[Durthang]] in the northern Ephel Dúath.<ref name=\"RKMap\">{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\nIn the north-west corner of Mordor the deep valley of [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]] was the only entrance for large armies, and that is where Sauron built the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor. In front of the Black Gate lay the [[Dagorlad]]. Sauron's main fortress [[Barad-dûr]] was at the foothills of [[Ered Lithui]]. To south-west of Barad-dûr lay the arid [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] and the volcanic [[Mount Doom]] (also called [[Orodruin]]);<ref name=\"RKMap\" /> to the east lay the plain of [[Lithlad]]. The land in the western parts of Mordor were largely infertile, producing only sparse [[Brambles of Mordor|brambles]].\n\nThe southern part of Mordor, [[Nurn]],<ref name=\"FRMap\" /> was slighly more fertile, and moist enough to carry the inland [[sea of Núrnen]]. Nurn was made somewhat fertile because the ash blown from Mount Doom left its soil nutrient rich, thus allowing dry-land farming. Unfortunately, the inland sea of Núrn was salty, not freshwater.  \n\nTo the west of Mordor was the narrow land of Ithilien with the great river [[Anduin]], to the east [[Rhûn]], and to the south-east, [[Khand]].<ref name=\"FRMap\" />\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[Melkor]] created Mount Doom in the long [[First Age]], and the name \"Mordor\" may have been given to the land before Sauron settled there because of its eruptions.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, p. 390 (note 14).</ref> Also in the First Age, the [[Drúedain]] migrated westward, and historians in Gondor believed that  they came through lands south of Mordor and, after turning northward into Ithilien, became the first Men to cross the Anduin.<ref>{{UT|12b}}, pp. 339-340.</ref>\n\nThe first being known to occupy the mountains of Mordor was Shelob, fleeing from the [[War of Wrath]] in [[Beleriand]] at the end of the First Age. She fed herself on [[Elves]] and [[Men]] living or passing nearby until these became scarce.<ref>{{TT|Lair}}</ref>\n\nSauron settled in Mordor around {{SA|1000}}. In the north-western corner of this land stood Mount Doom, in which [[the One Ring]] would be forged. Near Orodruin he built his stronghold [[Barad-dûr]]. After this time, Sauron was known as the [[Dark Lord|Dark Lord of Mordor]].\n\nFor two and a half thousand years, Sauron ruled Mordor uninterruptedly. It was from Mordor that he [[War of the Elves and Sauron|made war against]] the [[Elves of Eregion]] and came to dominate most of Eriador in a period known as the [[Dark Years]]. That was until he was repelled by the [[High Men]] of [[Númenor]]. Retreating to Mordor, Sauron then directed his power over the far south and east of Mordor conquering and dominating the savage tribes of the [[Easterlings]] and the [[Haradrim]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> Almost a thousand years later, Sauron was captured by the Númenóreans and brought to their island kingdom, eventually causing its [[Númenor#Destruction|destruction]]. Sauron returned to Mordor as a spirit and resumed his rule.\n\n===The Last Alliance and Third Age===\nSauron's rule was interrupted yet again when his efforts to overthrow the surviving Men and Elves failed, and they fought their way back to their foe's domain. After several months of siege in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], forces of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] came into Mordor. Sauron was defeated in a final battle and the Dark Tower was leveled to the ground, but Mordor was not settled by Men because of the dreadful memory of Sauron, and Orodruin.<ref name=\"rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Kings of Gondor]] built watchtowers and fortresses around Mordor, such as the mountain fortress of [[Durthang]], the [[Towers of the Teeth]] at the [[Morannon]], and the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]], in order to prevent Sauron's servants from returning to Mordor.<ref name=\"Tower\">{{RK|Tower}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Gondor had failed in the long run; during the [[Great Plague]], the population was so diminished that troops were recalled and the fortresses abandoned.<ref>{{App|South}}</ref><ref>{{App|TA}}, {{TA|1640}}</ref> Deprived of guard, Mordor began to fill with evil things again, and it is said the first shadow was the [[Lord of the Nazgûl]] ({{TA|1980}}) who summoned the other [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], first appearing since the [[War of the Last Alliance]], to prepare the return of Sauron.<ref name=\"rings\" /><ref name=\"ta\" /> [[Minas Ithil]] was conquered by the Ringwraiths in {{TA|2002}}; other fortifications that were supposed to defend Gondor from the menace inside Mordor were captured and turned into a means of shielding Mordor. Sauron resided in [[Dol Guldur]], until the [[White Council]] [[Attack on Dol Guldur|attacked]] it in {{TA|2941}}, forcing Sauron to flee.\n\nMeanwhile Mordor had been long prepared for him, and declaring himself openly he returned to Mordor in {{TA|2951}}, where he finished reconstructing his Dark Tower.<ref name=\"ta\">{{App|TA}}</ref><ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> By that time Mordor was protected too well to be captured by any military might that was available to the Free Peoples; in the north of Mordor during the War of the Ring were the great garrisons and forges of war, while surrounding the bitter inland [[Sea of Núrnen]] to the south lay the vast fields tended for the provision of the armies by hordes of slaves brought in from lands to the east and south.\n\n===War of the Ring===\nDuring the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered all his forces to Mordor. After the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], a Host of the West went to the Black Gate. Sauron sent his army to destroy the Men of Gondor and Rohan, but then [[Frodo Baggins]] destroyed the One Ring and Mordor fell. The Dark Tower, the Black Gate and the Towers of Teeth collapsed to ruin. Mount Doom exploded. Both Sauron and his Ringwraiths were apparently destroyed.\n\nAfter the ultimate defeat of Sauron, Mordor became mostly empty again as the [[Orcs]] inside it fled or were killed. Crippled by thousands of years of abuse and neglect, but capable of sustaining life, the land of Mordor was given to the defeated foes of Gondor as a consolation, as well as to the freed slaves of Nurn who were formerly forced to farm there to feed the armies of Mordor.\n\n==Etymology==\n'''''Mordor''''' is a [[Sindarin]] name. It means \"Black Land\". It is a compound of ''[[mor|MOR-]]'' (\"black, dark\") and ''[[dôr]]'' (\"land\").<ref>{{L|144}}, paragraph about the Black Speech</ref><ref>{{S|Elements}}, entries ''mor'', ''dôr''</ref>\n\nIts name in [[Khuzdul]] was '''''Nargûn''''', which contains the element ''narg'' (\"black\").<ref>{{RS|4XXVN}}, note 39, p. 466</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Mordor Map.jpeg|thumb|Early map of Mordor produced by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in the 1940s.]]\nThe first ever reference to Sauron's land is mentioned without a name, in the story of the Fall, written in the 1930s, as an inner land far from the sea, over the mountains. There [[Thû]] had a fortress, and \"[[Amroth]]\" assailed him.<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}</ref> The name Mordor, the Black Country, appears first time in the second version of that text, along with Elendil and Gil-galad (both of them mentioned first time).<ref>{{LR|P1II3}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIt is not uncommon for names in Tolkien's fiction to have relevant meanings in several languages, both those invented by Tolkien, and \"real\" ones, but this of course happens with any two languages.\n\n*A proposed etymology is [[Old English]] ''morðor'', which means \"mortal sin\" and later \"murder\".\n*''Mordor'' is also a name cited in some Nordic mythologies referring to a land where its citizens practice evil without knowing it, imposed on themselves by the society long created for that purpose.\n\nTolkien is reported to have identified Mordor with the volcano of [[Wikipedia:Stromboli|Stromboli]] off Sicily.<ref>[[Clyde S. Kilby]], [[Dick Plotz]] ([[1968]]), \"Many Meetings with Tolkien: An Edited Transcript of Remarks at the December 1966 [[Mythopoeic Society|TSA Meeting]]\", ''Niekas'' (Niekas Publications, New Hampshire, USA) (19): 39–40  Referred to at tolkienguide.com and by another publication of the Niekas editor.

The atlas was however published before ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', where it turned out that the [[Sea of Rhûn]] existed already in the First Age, notwithstanding that Mordor, due to the creation of the volcanic [[Mount Doom]], could have been uplifted from the Sea of Helcar during this time.\n\n'''2001-3: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)]]'':'''\n:The proximity of Mount Doom and Barad-dûr is at a distance that is non-canonical.{{citation needed}}\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Mordor map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Mordor in''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' ]]\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor|Mordor]]'' expansion added the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] as a region dvided into five distinct areas: '''[[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]]''' where the massive forge-works of the enemy are located, the plain of '''Dor Amarth''' between [[Ered Lithui]] and [[Mount Doom]], the valley of '''Lhingris''' between [[Ephel Dúath]] and [[Morgai]], '''Talath Urui''' to the south of [[Orodruin]] where a lake of molten lava now spews and '''Agarnaith''', a swamp-infested area to the east of Mount Doom and to the south of [[Barad-dûr]].\n:The ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Minas Morgul|Minas Morgul]]'' expansion added the [[Morgul Vale]] and an alternate version of Dor Amarth, chronologically set in [[Second Age 3440|S.A. 3440]].\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:'''1 September: ''[[A Shadow of the Past]]'':'''\n::Before the rise of [[Sauron]], the land of Mordor was known as the '''Southlands''' and the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] was inhabited by [[Men]] who called themselves [[Pre-Númenóreans|Southlanders]].

The Hobbits had an extensive agricultural system in the Shire, but did not proceed with industrialisation. Various supplies could be found in the Shire, including cereals, fruit, wood and [[pipe-weed]] (a favourite treat of Hobbits).\n\nThe Shire was quite densely populated in parts with many villages and a few towns, but it still was open enough to allow for wide forested areas and marshes. There were green, rolling hills and freshly tilled earth, along with gardens and flower boxes on window sills.\n\nThanks to the protective presence of the [[Rangers of the North]] in the lands of the former Arnor, the Shire for centuries ignored the wide world outside, despite being traversed by the [[East Road]].\n\nFrom the west to the east, the Shire originally measured 40 leagues (120 miles) from the [[Far Downs]] to the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. From the north to the south, it measured 50 leagues (150 miles) from the [[North Moors|northern moors]] to the [[marshes in the south]].<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" /> The total area of the Shire must have extended roughly about 20,000 square miles.<ref group=\"note\">[[Robert Foster]] estimates the total area of the Shire to be \"about 18,000 square miles\"; [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] has calculated a larger figure, about 21,400 square miles. See: {{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Shire\" and {{HM|AME}}, revised edn (London: HarperCollins, 1991), p. 69</ref>\n\nIn {{SR|1452}}, [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] gave the [[Westmarch]] to the [[Shire-hobbits]] as a gift. This extended the western boundaries of the Shire to the [[Tower Hills]].<ref name=\"AppB5\" /> [[Buckland]], to the east of the Brandywine, remained an independent region occupied by [[Hobbits]].\n\n[[File:Christopher Tolkien - A Part of the Shire.jpg|thumb|500px|center|''[[A Part of the Shire]]'' by [[Christopher Tolkien]]]]\n\nThe boundaries of the Shire were as follows:<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" />\n\n{{navigation\n| title=Boundaries of the Shire\n| north-west=\n| north=[[North Moors]]\n| north-east=Possibly [[Dwaling]]\n| west=[[Tower Hills]]\n| east=[[Baranduin|Brandywine River]]\n| south-west=\n| south=[[Marshes in the south]]\n| south-east=Possibly [[Sarn Ford]]\n}}\n\n==History==\n<!--\"See also\" in Eriador#Foundation of the Shire links here-->\n{{Quote|But it is not your own Shire. Others dwelt here before hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for ever fence it out.|[[Gildor Inglorion]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[Three is Company]]\"}}\nThe Shire was a fertile and well-tilled part of [[Arnor]], with many royal farms, [[corn]]lands, vineyards, and woods. It had long been deserted during the waning days of the Kingdom when it was known as the splinter-realm of [[Arthedain]];<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" /> it had been the hunting grounds of the [[King of Arnor]].<ref>{{PM|Prologue}}, p.9</ref> The [[Hobbits]] from [[Bree]] got official permission from King [[Argeleb II]] at Norbury ([[Fornost]]) to settle the lands. This was finally done in {{TA|1601}} (Year 1 in [[Shire Reckoning]]) by Hobbits from [[Bree]], led by the brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]].<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" /> They were joined by other hobbits who lived in [[Dunland]] and parts of depopulated [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]].\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - One Morning Long Ago.jpg|thumb|left|''One Morning Long Ago'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nBy 30 years later, almost all of the Hobbits of Middle-earth could be found in the Shire. The [[Shire-hobbits]] considered themselves as subjects of the [[Kings of Arthedain|King]], at least nominally, considering the isolation of their country. Nevertheless the Hobbits sent some support troops to the great battles Arnor fought against [[Angmar]]. After the fall of Arnor, the Shire remained a minor but independent political unit and the title of [[Thain]] was established to fill the absence of a Kingship.<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" />\n\nIts small size, relative lack of importance, and brave and resilient Hobbit population made it too modest an objective for conquest. More important was that the Shire was guarded and protected by the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North]] (and [[Gandalf]]), who watched the borders and kept out intruders. The only strangers to enter the Shire were the [[Dwarves]] travelling on the [[East Road]] that ran through the Shire to and from their mines in the [[Blue Mountains]], and the occasional [[Elves]] on their way to the [[Emyn Beraid]] or the [[Grey Havens]].\n\nIn {{TA|2340}}, the [[Oldbucks]] of the [[Marish]] crossed the [[Brandywine]] because of overpopulation and founded [[Buckland]].\n\nHowever, the Shire faced its adversities since it was inside the range of the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}}, and [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Goblins]] from [[Mount Gram]] invaded the Shire until they were driven out after the [[Battle of Greenfields]] ({{TA|2747}}). The Shire also suffered because of the [[Long Winter]] ({{TA|2758}}) soon followed by the [[Days of Dearth]] ({{TA|2760}}) and the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] ({{TA|2911}}) when [[White Wolves]] entered the Shire.<ref name=\"AppB2\" />\n\n[[Saruman]] followed Gandalf's interest for the Hobbits and put spies in Bree and Southfarthing. In the years leading up to the [[War of the Ring]], his spies saw that the Shire was closely guarded by the Rangers. When Gandalf suspected that Bilbo Baggins possessed the [[One Ring]] the guard was doubled<ref name=\"AppB2\" /> (perhaps at his request to [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]] [[Aragorn]]).\n\n===War of the Ring===\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], the Shire was first visited by the Nine [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] when the Rangers were off to the War. This left the Shire defenseless, leaving it open to be captured by Sharkey (Alias of Saruman) and some [[Ruffians]], through the use of [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]. It was liberated after [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] returned from Gondor. Their victory at the [[Battle of Bywater]] and the death of Saruman put a final end to the War.\n\nYet the physical damage which Saruman caused by forced industrialisation was undone by the Hobbits' efforts and the soil from [[Lothlórien]] (given to Sam by [[Galadriel]]) and {{TA|3021}} was considered to be the most productive and prosperous year in their history.\n\n===Fourth Age===\nWith [[Aragorn]]'s return as the King of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], the Shire joined the [[Reunited Kingdom]]<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref> and in {{FoA|6}} became a Free Land, protected enclave inside the Kingdom; a royal order forbade the entrance of any one other than [[Hobbits]] into the Shire. In {{FoA|31}}, King Aragorn extended the land westwards to [[Emyn Beraid]]; this land was named [[Westmarch]] and many hobbits relocated there.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - The Shire.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The Shire in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]\nAt its founding, the Shire was a part of Arthedain and the Hobbits considered themselves to be subjects of the King. It was only after the fall of Arthedain that the Shire became an independent state. Once independent, the Hobbits of the Shire selected a '''[[Thain]]''' to lead them. The office of Thain was hereditary, initially belonging to the [[Oldbuck Family|Oldbuck]] family. When the Oldbucks left the Shire for [[Buckland]], the office passed to the [[Took Family|Took]] family of [[Tuckborough]]. While nominally the Thain ruled over the four [[Farthings]], in practice authority was so decentralised that the title was seen as more of a formality and ceremonial.\n\nThe Shire was originally divided into four [[Farthings]] ([[Northfarthing]], [[Southfarthing]], [[Eastfarthing]], and [[Westfarthing]]). Within the Farthings there were smaller, unofficial divisions, such as towns or regions associated with particular families. The [[Took Family|Tooks]], for instance, mostly lived in or near [[Tuckborough]]. In many cases, Hobbit family names were derived from their places of origin. For example, [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s surname was derived from the town of [[Gamwich]] whence the family originated. \n\nThe only elected official of the Shire was the '''[[Mayor of Michel Delving]]''' in the [[White Downs]] (by extension seen as the mayor of the Shire). The Mayor's chief duties were serving as postmaster of the Shire's [[Messenger Service]], charging the [[Watch]], and presiding at fairs.\n\nThe sole law enforcement officials in the Shire were the [[Shirriffs]]. Their primary responsibility was the protection of the Shire from trespassers. There were three in each Farthing and were distinguished from \"civilians\" by a feather worn in their caps. The [[Bounders]] were the land's border-guard, charged with turning back unwanted people or beasts; their number varied according to need.\n\nAfter [[Westmarch]] was added to the Shire, the Thain established the title of [[Warden of Westmarch]]. This was a hereditary office with unclear responsibilities. It was first given to the [[Fairbairn family|Fairbairns]], descendants of Samwise Gamgee. \n\nBuckland, which was not part of the Shire proper, was controlled by the '''[[Master of Buckland]]''' at [[Bucklebury]]. The office of Master was established by the Oldbucks when they left the Shire. Their descendants continued to hold the office when they became the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]].\n\n==Etymology==\nA \"shire\" ([[Old English]] ''scír'') is an organised region with a county town, which in the case of the Hobbits' Shire was [[Michel Delving]].<ref name=\"Nomen\" /> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that the usual Germanic word for \"district\", represented in Dutch by ''gouw'' and in German by ''Gau'', was replaced in English by ''scír'' at an early date. ''Ge'', the English cognate of these words, survives only in a handful of place-names, such as [[wikipedia:Surrey|''Surrey'']] (from Old English ''Suðer-ge'', \"southern district\").<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 775</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nThe original [[Westron]] name for \"Shire\" was '''''[[Sûza]]''''',<ref name=\"AppF\">{{App|F2}}</ref> while the definite form (\"''The'' Shire\") was ''Sûza-t''.<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 45</ref>\n\nThe [[Sindarin]] name is only attested in the [[Lenition|lenited]] form '''''Drann''''' and the adjectival ''Drannail'',<ref>[[Vinyar Tengwar 31|''Vinyar Tengwar'' 31]], \"The ''King's Letter'': An Historical and Comparative Analysis\" by [[Carl F. Hostetter]], pp. 21-22</ref><ref>{{SD|XI2}}, p. 129</ref> so it would be ''Trann''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1044609725.html|articlename=S. #''Trann'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n{{quote|I could draw you a map of every inch of [Sarehole] [...] I loved it with an intensity of love that was a kind of nostalgia reversed [...] It was a kind of lost paradise and it was wonderful.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] interview to John Ezard<ref>''[[Oxford Mail]]'', [[3 August]] [[1966]], p. 4</ref>}}\nOn Tolkien's maps, the Shire is located at about the same position as England is on modern European maps and has been cited as an example of [[Wikipedia:Deep England|Deep England]] ideology (though, of course, England is on an island while the Shire is a landlocked country). Throughout the narrative, Tolkien also implies numerous points of similarity between the two, such as weather, agriculture and dialect. One can also see England as Tolkien's source of inspiration for the Shire in its very name. Tolkien had spent his youth in [[Sarehole]], Worcestershire.\n\nAccording to [[Paula Marmor]], the hobbit brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]] bear names related to horses, parallel to [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]], the [[Wikipedia:Hengest and Horsa|legendary leaders]] who brought the Saxons to Britain. Hengest was the founder of [[Wikipedia:Kent|Kent]] whose geography is similar to the Shire (North Downs above, hills to the west, water to the east and marshes to the southeast).<ref>{{HM|IE}}, \"An etymological excursion among the Shire-Folk\" by [[Paula Marmor]]</ref>\n\nThe industrialisation of the Shire was based on Tolkien's witnessing of the extension of the Industrial Revolution to rural Warwickshire during his youth, and especially the deleterious consequences thereof. The rebellion of the hobbits and the restoration of the pre-industrial Shire may be interpreted as a prescription of voluntary simplicity as a remedy to the problems of modern society.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Pictures of the Shire in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Hobbiton.jpg|The Shire in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - The Shire map.jpg|Map of the Shire from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - The Yondershire map.jpg|Map of the \"Yondershire\" from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n===Films===\n'''1977: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:The Shire is featured in the opening and last scenes of the film.

Also, part of the [[Northfarthing]] is placed within the borders of [[Evendim]] region for gameplay purposes. The Shire is inhabited by hundreds of non-playable characters, involved in hundreds of quests.\n\n:In 2022 an extension to the region called \"[[the Yondershire]]\" was added. This area includes the Shire's less-tamed north-western reaches and the surrounding territory, reaching to the [[Lhûn|River Lune]] in the west and the [[Hills of Evendim]] in the north. It encompasses the rest of the Northfarthing, and most of the Westfarthing that wasn't yet in the game.

The entryway was a tube-shaped hall with paneled walls and a tiled floor, furnished with carpeting, polished chairs, and an abundance of pegs for the hats and coats of many visitors.  The tunnel continued into the hill with side doors that were also round.  All of the rooms were on the same level – bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, multiple pantries, wardrobes, kitchens, and dining rooms.  The best rooms were those on the left side of the passage for they had deep-set round windows with a view of the garden and meadows beyond down to [[The Water]].<ref name=\"Unexpected\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{quote|You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.|[[Sandyman]]<ref name=\"Party\">{{FR|Party}}</ref>|center}}\n\nBag End was built into [[Hobbiton Hill]] by [[Bungo Baggins]], where he went to live with his new wife, [[Belladonna Took]].

The [[23 September|next day]] of the party and Bilbo's disappearance, many hobbits crowded Bag End to inquire what happened and to collect farewell gifts. This caused the rumor that Bilbo's household was given out for free and many came for loot; they tried to loot overlooked small items, make swaps or deals, even mixed or removed labels from presents that Bilbo prepared. Three young hobbits even knocked holes in the walls of one of the cellars, and [[Sancho Proudfoot]] dug in the larger pantry, looking for Bilbo's mysterious treasure. Frodo attempted to block the entrance with barrows and handcarts and had [[Merry Brandybuck]] to keep an eye.<ref name=\"Party\"/> \n\nWhen he too left [[The Shire]], he sold it to Lobelia by [[June]] {{TA|3018}}. Frodo had bought a house at [[Crickhollow]] and his friends helped him empty and pack his household, and celebrated with them his last [[22 September|birthday]] party in Hobbiton. The title would pass to Lobelia on [[24 September]], but she arrived [[23 September|one day early]] with her son [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] to inspect the remaining items. Leaving Bag End, Frodo left the keys with his neighbor [[Gaffer Gamgee]].<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> It was used by Lotho as he declared himself [[Chief Shirriff]]. [[Sharkey]] also adopted the hole as his base, digging up Bagshot Row and erecting many houses in its stead. After the [[Battle of Bywater]], it was largely restored to normal, and Frodo took up residence in the hole again.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Frodo Baggins]] left [[Middle-earth]], he gave Bag End to [[Samwise Gamgee]], whose family, the Gardners, would live in it for many years.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[J.R.R.

The pantry was designed to be overly-stocked whilst the whole home - especially the bedroom - was stuffed with plump furnishings to reflect Bilbo's \"comfortable\" lifestyle.<ref>[[Daniel Falconer]], ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Chronicles: Art & Design]]'', pp. 16-20</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Images of Bag End|Images of Bag End]]\n*''[[Tolkien's Bag End]]''\n\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:The Shire]]\n[[de:Beutelsend]]\n[[fi:Repunpää]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:comte:cul-de-sac]]",

There, for many thousands of years, a thriving [[Dwarf realms|Dwarvish community]] created the greatest city ever known. \n\nIt lay in the central parts of the [[Misty Mountains]], tunnelled and carved through the living rock of the mountains themselves. By the [[Second Age]] a traveller could pass through it from the west of the range to the east. \n\n==History==\n===Elder Days===\nIt was founded in very ancient days by [[Durin]] who awoke at [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] in the [[Misty Mountains]]. He came upon the valley [[Azanulbizar]] beneath the mountains. He looked into a shimmering lake and saw a [[Durin's Crown|crown of stars]] reflected in its waters. He named that lake [[Kheled-zâram]], the [[Mirrormere]] and it remained a revered place among Dwarves of all houses ever afterwards, and the [[Durin's Stone]] was erected on the location of that event.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> \n\nThere, in the caves above, Durin and [[Longbeards|his people]] started the delving and building of the [[Great Gates]] of Khazad-dûm, and the [[First Hall]] leading to a [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm|bridge over a chasm]]. From there began the expansion, both to ''Levels'' above and to ''Deeps'' below, and mines expanding out from the inhabited areas of the city proper.\n\nAs the centuries passed, the realm of Durin became the greatest of all their mansions, and became famous even to the distant west; the [[Elves]] of [[Beleriand]], heard its rumour from the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]] on their borders.<ref name=Sindar />\n\nDurin the Deathless died before the end of the First Age, and was buried in a tomb in Khazad-dûm<ref name=Durin>{{App|A3}}</ref> and his descendants continued to rule.\n\n===Second Age===\n{{quote|After the end of the [[First Age]] the power and wealth of Khazad-dûm was much increased; for it was enriched by many people and much lore and craft...|[[Appendix A]]}}\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Doors of Durin.jpg|thumb|left|''The Doors of Durin'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\n\nIn c. {{SA|40}}, most of the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]] began leaving en masse from their now ruined cities for Khazad-dûm. The city was enriched not just in numbers, but in the western Houses' skills in smithing, crafting and masonry. All these factors created a renaissance for Khazad-dûm, and brought its prosperity to its zenith.<ref name=\"B1\">{{App|B1}}</ref>\n\nKhazad-dûm had expanded so much that it completely traversed the Mountains from east to west, ending to the western rocky cliffs at their base, the [[Walls of Moria]].<ref name=Journey>{{FR|II4}}</ref> [[Narvi]] with the [[Lord of Eregion]], [[Celebrimbor]], constructed the magical [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]].<ref name=Durin/> \n\nThe friendship of Khazad-dûm and [[Eregion]] came to a sudden end, however, in {{SA|1697}}. [[Sauron]] [[Sack of Eregion|overran]] the country of the Elves. Durin's warriors withdrew from the Gates, and they shut them against Sauron, also secluding  the kingdom off from the outside world.<ref name=TA>{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nIt was also during this time that the Orcs reinvaded the mountains and made war on the Dwarves, [[First Sacking of Gundabad|taking]] [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] from the Kingdom of Durin.\n\n===Third Age===\n====Demise====\nMost of its great wealth was based on the rare ''[[Mithril]]'' that was found in its mines, and as the centuries passed, the Dwarves mined deeper and deeper for the precious metal. In the year {{TA|1980}}, their deep digging unleashed a nameless terror, a [[Balrog]] from the [[Elder Days]], that wreaked dreadful destruction, and in slaying the  King, [[Durin VI]], became known as [[Durin's Bane]]. In the following year, Durin's son, [[Náin I]], was also lost, and the Dwarves fled their ancient home. \n\nAfter millennia as one of the richest cities in [[Middle-earth]], Khazad-dûm stood dark and empty, but for the brooding menace the Dwarves had released. In that time it was given a new name, Moria, the '''Black Pit'''.\n\nThe monster - a Balrog of [[Morgoth]], as was later known - lurked alone in Moria for nearly five hundred years. After that time, around {{TA|2480}} [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orcs]] made secret strongholds in the Mountains and [[Sauron]] started to populate the old city of Khazad-dûm with his creatures.<ref name=TA /> Orcs from the North began to enter the abandoned city to raid its treasuries, and occupy it. Though the orcs' numbers were greatly reduced in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar|Battle of Nanduhirion]], fought in the valley beneath Moria's [[Great Gates|East-gate]] in {{TA|2799|n}}, the Balrog could not be bested, and Khazad-dûm remained a place of darkness.\n\nAt some point between {{TA|2845|n}} and [[Third Age 2850|2850]] the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] entered the city looking for King [[Thráin II]] who had disappeared on journey to Erebor.<ref name=Journey/>\n\n====Balin's Colony====\n[[File:Joona Kujanen - Battle for Moria.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Battle for Moria'' by [[:Category:Images by Joona Kujanen|Joona Kujanen]]]]\nIn {{TA|2989|n}}, there was an attempt by the Longbeards to reclaim their ancient home. The [[Balin's Colony|expedition]] was led by [[Balin]], who had accompanied [[Bilbo Baggins]] on the [[Quest of Erebor]]. He led a [[Balin's Colony|colony]] of Dwarves there from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. The Colony was successful at first, killing a considerable number of Orcs, taking many of the Eastern halls and finding many lost treasures such as [[Durin's Axe]]. They were however [[Last stand of Balin's folk|defeated and slain]] by the Orcs in {{TA|2994|n}}.  \n\nAt some point either before or after the colony, [[Aragorn]], [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], entered Moria for some unknown purpose.\n\n====The Fellowship's passage====\nWhen [[Frodo Baggins]] set out from [[Rivendell]] with the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]], they at first planned to travel over the Misty Mountains. When they were stopped by heavy snow on [[Caradhras|Mount Caradhras]], they found themselves pursued by wolves and Orcs, and fled into Moria, so as to go under the mountains. There, they found Balin's journal in the [[Book of Mazarbul]] and learned the fate of his expedition. They were then set upon by a host of [[Trolls]] and Orcs, and they discovered that the terror was, in fact, a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] of [[Morgoth]]. Gandalf fought the Balrog on a narrow bridge and succeeded in destroying a section of bridge to make the Balrog fall. As it fell, the Balrog snagged Gandalf's leg with its whip of thongs and pulled him after it, sending them both plunging into the abyss spanned by the bridge. The rest of the Fellowship managed to escape Moria and reach [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] mostly unharmed.\n\nUnknown to the Fellowship, both Gandalf and the Balrog survived the fall and fought a ferocious battle from the depths of Moria to the mountains above, demolishing the top of the legendary [[Endless Stair]] and a part of the surrounding mountain peak in the process. Gandalf cast down the Balrog upon the mountainside and lived just long enough to see it die, but his story was not yet ended.\n\nWhile Gandalf had felled the Balrog, Moria remained a place of evil creatures until the Fourth Age.<ref>{{SD|XI2}}, p. 122</ref>\n\n===Later history===\nThough little information is given, the retaking of Khazad-dûm by [[Durin VII]] seems to have occurred sometime after {{FoA|171}}.<ref group=\"note\">The mention of Durin's name as a prophecy in the [[Appendix A]], and considering that the Appendix derives from the [[Red Book]] (copied {{FoA|171}}), seems to suggest that he was probably born, or emerged, after that date.</ref> As the [[King of Durin's Folk]], he led a final return to the city. He was successful; the [[House of Durin]] reclaimed their inheritance and the hammers rang again in their great halls beneath the Misty Mountains until the race of Dwarves ended.<ref name=Fourth>{{PM|Aiv}}, p. 278</ref>\n\n==Layout==\n{{sources}}\nKhazad-dûm was a huge array of chambers, passages, mines, halls, stores and pits. In general, areas were either classed as the ''Mines of Moria''<ref name=Mines>{{FR|Journey}}, p. 310</ref> or the ''city''.<ref name=City>{{FR|Journey}}, p. 315</ref> The mines were the working sections of Khazad-dûm whilst the city contained the habitable parts. The city of Moria was located close to the eastern end of Moria.<ref name=City/> The distance from the west gate of Moria to the East-gate of Moria was at least forty miles.<ref name=Mines/>\n[[File:Paul Monteagle - The Bridge of Khazad-dum.jpg|thumb|''The Bridge of Khazad-dum'' by [[:Category:Images by Paul Monteagle|Paul Monteagle]]]]\nThe city areas of Khazad-dûm were located in the east. Old Moria, the oldest mansions and passages,<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Old Moria'', p. 294</ref> were located close to the [[Great Gates]].<ref name=OldMoria>{{FR|Bridge}}, pp. 328-9</ref> The North end was the part of Moria that had been excavated north of the older halls and the Great Gates<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''North end'', p. 291</ref> and included the twenty first hall and the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] with the [[Balin's Tomb|tomb]] of [[Balin]].<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}, p. 321</ref> They were structured into seven Levels and seven Deeps. The Levels stretched above the Great Gates with the First Level being on the same level as the Great Gates<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}, p. 323</ref> whilst the Deeps were set deeper within the mountain below the level of the Great Gates with the First Deep being immediately below the Great Gates. The First Deep included the Second Hall, which was no more than a quarter of a mile from the East-gate and a part of Old Moria. The eastern end was the part of Moria, which was just west of the East-gate. The First Hall was located on the same level as the East-gate<ref name=OldMoria/> and had high windows on its eastern side, which allowed bright daylight to illuminate the hall.<ref name=FirstHall>{{FR|Bridge}}, pp. 331-2</ref> Immediately to the east of the hall was the East-gate.<ref name=FirstHall/>\n\nThe eastern section of the city spaces had also been delved in such a manner as to have light shafts to illuminate their chambers. One example of this is the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] which was located on the eastern edge of the [[Seventh Level]].\n\nThe mine areas of Khazad-dûm were interlaced with the city spaces, but spread also westward toward the [[Doors of Durin]]. The mines ran deeper and further than any other tunnels within Khazad-dûm, and it is possible that more of the lower Deeps were given over to mining, although this is only conjecture.\n\nThe defined change between ''mines'' and ''city'' can be seen when the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] pass through Moria - there is a marked difference between the early passages and chambers and those of the city structures illuminated by Gandalf.\n\nFar below Moria, there are abysses, spaces and tunnels not known even by the Dwarves, but known by the Balrog. [[Nameless things]] gnaw the earth and make them, far from the knowledge of any lore.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Moria'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Black Chasm\"<ref name=Letter>{{L|297}}, pp. 382-3</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 40</ref> or \"Black Pit\",<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 283</ref><ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 35</ref> being a combination of the elements ''[[morn|mor(n)]]'' (\"black\") + ''[[iâ]]'' (\"void, abyss\").<ref name=Letter/><ref name=PE17/><ref>{{S|Elements}}, entries ''mor'' and ''iâ''</ref> The name was given by the [[Elves]] \"without love\", because they preferred to live above ground.<ref name=Translation>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1137</ref>\n\nThe presence of the name ''Moria'' on the [[West-gate of Moria]] is often seen as an [[Possible inconsistencies in the legendarium#Doors of Durin|inconsistency]], but as just explained, the name had not necessarily bad connotations.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 281-2</ref>\n\nIn the [[Noldorin]] phase of the [[Elvish]] language, ''Moria'' was glossed as \"Black Gulf\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[YAG]]\"</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nThe name ''Khazad-dûm'' in [[Khuzdul]] means \"Dwarves' Mansion(s)\".

The iconic location are portrayed immediately next to each other and in the end, Gandalf defeats the Balrog and continues journey with the Fellowship.\n\n'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria]]'':'''\n:''Mines of Moria'' was the first major expansion of the game, released in November 2008. Almost the entirety of Moria is present in the game, with players able to freely journey from the West Gate to the East Gate and from the Cliffs of Zirakzigil to the very Foundations of Stone where nameless things dwell.\n\n:Moria is divided into several major sub-areas, depicted on the map to the right. '''The Great Delving''' lies directly next to the West Gate and links ancient Dwarven mines to palaces, academies and foundries founded during Khazad-dum's glory days. '''Durin's Way''' is the area, where, according to legend, Durin himself first braved the mines before bringing his folk in there. '''Zelem-Melek''' is home to both numerous [[Orcs|Orc]] encampments and the famed [[Twenty-first Hall]]. '''Silvertine Lodes''' refers to the mining area located directly under [[Celebdil|Silvertine]], much like the '''Redhorn Lodes''' are the mining area under the peaks of [[Caradhras#The Redhorn Gate|Redhorn]]. '''The Water-Works''' hosts both a large underground lake and ancient Dwarven gears, wheels and devices that delivered the fresh water throughout the whole kingdom once. '''The Flaming Deeps''' is an area that reeks with fire and where few could survive for long - it appears that [[Durin's Bane]] resided there following his reawakening. '''Nud-Melek''' mostly consists of the [[Second Hall]] and the [[First Hall]]. The '''Foundations of Stone''' are located below the deepest delving of the Dwarves; no light has ever shined there and, as Gandalf recounted, nameless things older than the world gnaw at the roots of the mountains.\n\n:Surprisingly for those seeing it for the first time, Moria in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' is very much inhabited. In an original storyline by Turbine, Dwarves from the [[Iron Hills]] sent by [[Dáin Ironfoot]] arrive in Moria shortly after the Fellowship to learn the fate of [[Balin]]'s expedition. With Durin's Bane recently gone, the Orcs and Goblins of Moria are in great disarray, which allows the Dwarves to move in and establish encampments at all major crossroads. Fresh supplies are coming from both East and West gates, preventing the Iron Hill Garrison from being cut off like Balin was. Shortly after the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Third Age, the Iron Garrison was expelled from Moria by overwhelming numbers of orcs and evil creatures.\n\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''\n:Several levels of both good and evil campaigns take place in Moria.\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:Moria, under the name Khazad-dûm, is featured in the first season of the show, with [[Elrond]] travelling there in order to encourage the relationships between Elves and Dwarves.\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n{{durinskings}}\n[[Category:Mines]]\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Moria]]\n[[Category:Evil realms]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Khazad-dûm]]\n[[fi:Moria]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/monts brumeux/khazad-dum]]",

It is said that before the [[War of the Last Alliance]], Elendil stood at the hill watching the hosts of [[Gil-galad]] coming to join his forces.<ref name=Knife />\n\nAfter King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] passed and the kingdom was split in three, all of his sons coveted the hill, or rather the [[Amon Sûl-stone|Stone]] inside. It lay on the exact tri-state point, but eventually passed to [[Arthedain]], the realm of [[Amlaith]], the eldest son of Eärendur, although it already possessed the [[Elostirion-stone|other]] [[Annúminas-stone|two]] Stones.<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\n===Destruction===\n[[File:Fall of Amon Sul RotWK.png|left|thumb|The Fall of Amon Sûl in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'']]\nIn the days of [[Argeleb I|Argeleb]], the royal lines of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] had failed. Argeleb therefore claimed both realms as his own, hoping to reunite [[Arnor]], but the claim was resisted by Rhudaur, where the Dúnedain had dwindled and the land was now largely ruled by hillmen, who were driven by the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]].\n\nAs tensions with Angmar increased, Argeleb fortified his border. A great bastion arose on Weathertop, and the East Road and lower Hoarwell were fortified also. For nigh half a century, the line held, though Argeleb lost his life in battle with the Hillmen. The Witch-king did not trouble the Men, and had sent his troops further East, to the [[Second Siege of Imladris]]. But in {{TA|1409}}, he came forth with such a force from Angmar that no army could stop him.

''[...]'' Greatest of the forests of the Northern world. I hope you like the look of it.|[[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', \"[[Queer Lodgings]]\"}}\n\n'''Mirkwood''' ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''Taur e-Ndaedelos''<ref name=\"LotRAppF\">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1134</ref>) was a great forest east of the river [[Anduin]] in [[Rhovanion]]. It was previously called Greenwood the Great ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''Eryn Galen'') until the Shadow of the influence of Sauron fell on it. It was named the [[Eryn Lasgalen|Wood of Greenleaves]] ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''[[Eryn Lasgalen]]'') when the shadow was lifted after the defeat of Sauron.\n\n== Geography ==\nMirkwood seems to have had much the same boundaries as it did at the end of the Third Age for most of its history. It was roughly rectangular in shape: stretching from the foothills of the [[Grey Mountains]] in the north to the [[North Undeep]] in the south, and from the east edge of the vale of [[Anduin]] to the [[Lonely Mountain]].\n\nIt was bisected by the ancient [[Old Forest Road]]. Later, when this road became unusable, a second path through the forest was made to the north. Between the two paths lay the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]]. The [[Forest River]] cut through the forest's northern end from its source in the western Grey Mountains, joined in the centre by the [[Enchanted River]] which flowed north from the Mountains of Mirkwood.\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Map of Wilderland.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] showing the northern part of Mirkwood.]]\nSouth of the Old Forest road the [[East Bight]] created the ''Narrows of the Forest'', only one hundred miles across. South and west of the narrows was the a hill called [[Amon Lanc]].\n\n== History ==\n=== First Age ===\n[[File:Lída Holubová - Mirkwood 2.jpg|thumb|Nandor in Mirkwood (art by [[Lída Holubová]]]]\nOriginally called Greenwood the Great, the forest may have once formed part of the vast primeval woodland which covered most of [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Years of the Trees]] in the [[First Age]], possibly linked to Lothlórien across the Anduin.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}} p. 252</ref> The [[Eldar]] passed through the area on their [[Great Journey|journey]] to [[Valinor]] and it was first populated at this time by the [[Nandor]]. Unwilling to cross the [[Misty Mountains]], these Elves settled also in the wooded valleys of the river Anduin. They multiplied and were joined by wandering [[Avari]], becoming known as Silvan or Wood-elves.\n\nThe Old Forest Road was constructed very early in Greenwood's history by the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]] to carry traffic between their territory in the Misty Mountains to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and the [[Iron Hills]].This road would be later abandoned as the [[Orcs]] of the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Grey Mountains]] took [[Mount Gundabad|Gundabad]] and the surrounding region, cutting off communication between Khazad-dûm and the Iron Hills and Erebor.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>\n\n=== Second Age ===\nIn around the year {{SA|750}}, the [[Sindar|Sinda]] prince, [[Oropher]], removed from [[Lindon]] to Greenwood where he was taken by the Silvan Elves as their lord. This forested region to the east of the [[Anduin]] is where [[Silvan Elves]], of [[Nandor]] descent and the [[Avari]], lived.<ref>{{PM|Second}}</ref> Oropher built his halls at [[Amon Lanc]] and was accepted as the leader of the Wood-elves of Greenwood, later the [[Elves of Mirkwood]], forming the [[Woodland Realm]].\n\nDuring the First and Second Age, the [[Northmen]], such as the ancestors of the [[Woodmen]], had been allies of the [[Longbeards]] and the [[Dwarves]] of the hills surrounding the Greenwood, and were enemies of the [[Orcs]] and [[Easterlings]].<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, third, fourth and seventh paragraph</ref> The Woodmen maintained friendly relations with the Elves of the Greenwood.<ref name=UT>{{UT|Gladden}}, ''The sources of the legend of Isildur's death'', first paragraph</ref>\n\n=== Third Age ===\nThe first millennium of the [[Third Age]] probably saw the creation of the East Bight by men living in the eastern eaves of the forest. These men may have formed part of the [[Rhovanion|Kingdom of Rhovanion]] led by [[Vidugavia]]. Men, such as the [[Éothéod]], and [[Hobbits]] also lived in the vale of Anduin and were likely responsible for the retreat of the forest's western border.\n[[File:Marya Filatova - Thranduil 2.jpg|thumb|\"[[Thranduil]]\" by [[Marya Filatova]]]]\nAt the beginning of the Third Age, [[Thranduil]] replaced [[Oropher]] as king of the Woodland Realm. Probably as a result of massive losses at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] the Silvan population of Greenwood was diminished and became mainly concentrated in the hills then known as [[Mountains of Mirkwood|Emyn Duir]]. At the beginning of the second millennium of the Third Age, a mysterious being came to Amon Lanc in the south of Greenwood the Great, and there built the stronghold known as [[Dol Guldur]]; \"hill of sorcery.\" This was the magician known as the Necromancer, who was later revealed to be none other than Sauron himself, and from his fortress tower a shadow of nightshade began to spread across the woodlands. The story of Sauron's darkening of Greenwood the Great mirrors events in the [[First Age]], when he occupied the highland forests of [[Dorthonion]], north of [[Beleriand]]. That region, too, fell under his shadow, and was also known as [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]]. From that time on, the Elves came to refer to the Greenwood as Taur-nu-Fuin, the forest under nightshade, rendered into the [[Mannish]] tongue as 'Mirkwood'.\n\nAround the [[Third Age 1636|same time]] as the [[Great Plague]] devastated [[Gondor]] and [[Eriador]], the [[Shadow]] grew deep in Greenwood and evil things reappeared. Later the wise noted this coincidence and considered it a sign of Sauron's return.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, by the time of [[Cirion]] (c. T.A. 2500), [[Dol Guldur]] controlled the [[Balchoth]], a tribe of [[Easterlings]] who dwelt east of Mirkwood; often they made raids through the forest up to the [[Vales of Anduin]], until they were all but deserted, until [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|defeated]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Elvenking's Gate.jpg|thumb|''The Elvenking's Gate'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nSauron's arrival caused a darkening of Greenwood, and at this point it became known as Mirkwood. The children of [[Shelob]], giant [[spiders]], as well as bats and orcs in Dol Guldur's service occupied the forest and it became thicker, darker and covered in cobwebs.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\nThis caused Thranduil to lead the Silvan population of Mirkwood to migrate north for the last time, north of the forest river. The Wood-elves specifically dwell  apparently exclusively in the [[Elvenking's Halls]] at the eastern end of the Forest River. The ancient Old Forest Road was abandoned by men and Dwarves alike, with a new but seldom used path being made further from Dol Guldur and the Hobbits near the forest's eastern border migrated away.\n\nMirkwood remained a place of fear throughout the Third Age, though the kingdoms of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and [[Dale]] flourished briefly in the time of the [[King under the Mountain|Kings under the Mountain]]. This prosperity was ended by the arrival of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] who brought yet further desolation to the area north-eastern Mirkwood. Small homesteads of 'Woodmen' are also recorded as living in the western edge of the forest south of the old road in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref>{{HM|H}}, \"Map of Wilderland\"</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2850|n}}, [[Gandalf]] visited Mirkwood and entered Dol Guldur, this time in secret. The Grey Pilgrim discovered that the Necromancer was none other than Sauron, who had regained his powers, millennia after the Battle of Dagorlad.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2850, p. 1088</ref>\n\n[[File:Galadriel dol guldur bfmeII.JPG|thumb|left|Galadriel casts down the walls of Dol Guldur]]\n[[File:Peter Pracownik - Five of Coins.jpeg|thumb|[[Thorin and Company|Thorin's Company]] in Mirkwood]]\nIn {{TA|2941}}, as [[Thorin and Company]] were going on the [[Quest of Erebor]], the shadow over Mirkwood was lifted, albeit temporarily. While Thorin and Company were journeying to Erebor, the [[White Council]], prompted by the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]]'s discovery of the true identity of Sauron drove him from Dol Guldur. Gandalf also planned the successful [[Quest of Erebor]], which resulted in the slaying of Smaug in the same year. The combination of these two events allowed the re-established kingdoms of Erebor and Dale and the flourishing of the Woodland Realm and of a confederacy of Woodmen led by the [[Beornings]]. The Darkness of Mirkwood was lifted for a while.\n\nOnly ten years after these events in {{TA|2951}} Sauron, now based in [[Mordor]], sent [[Khamûl]] and two other [[Nazgûl]] to reoccupy Dol Guldur.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2951, p. 1089</ref>\n\nOn 21 March {{TA|3018|n}}, [[Aragorn]] who had captured [[Gollum]] in the [[Dead Marshes]] arrived with Gollum in Mirkwood.<ref>{{UT|Other}}</ref>\n\nTwo days later, on 23 March {{TA|3018|n}}, Gandalf arrived in Mirkwood<ref name=Note6>{{UT|Other}} note 6</ref> and began to interrogate Gollum.<ref>{{UT|Other}} and note 4</ref>\n\nOn 29 March {{TA|3018|n}}, Gandalf left Mirkwood.<ref name=Note6/>\n\nOn 20 June, Orcs attacked the Elves of Mirkwood and Gollum was able to escape from his captivity.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, June 20, p. 1093</ref> Afterwards Legolas leaves Mirkwood to travel to Rivendell to attend the Council of Elrond and to report that Gollum has escaped.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 255</ref>\n\nOn 11, 15 and 22 March {{TA|3019|n}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 11, March 15 and March 22, pp. 1093-1094</ref> forces from Dol Guldur assaulted the realm of Lórien, but they were repulsed each time because of the valor of the Elves of Lórien and by the power of Galadriel, but the woods on the borders of Lórien were seriously damaged.<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}, p. 1094</ref>\n\nOn 15 March {{TA|3019|n}}, the day of the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] in front of Minas Tirith,<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 15, p. 1094</ref> forces from Dol Guldur invaded the realm of Thranduil in Mirkwood.

They divided the forest between them so that the realm of Thranduil encompassed the northern part of the wood down to the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]] and that the realm of Celeborn encompassed the southern part of the wood south of the [[Narrows of the Forest]], which was named East Lórien by Celeborn. Thranduil and Celeborn gave all the wide forest between the Mountains of Mirkwood and  the Narrows of the Forest to the [[Beornings]] and the [[Woodmen]].<ref name=Great/>\n\n=== Fourth Age ===\nThough initially they prospered as the darkness was lifted, the elves of the Wood of Greenleaves were destined either to depart for Valinor or fade into rustic forest spirits. The forest probably then ultimately fell under the dominion of Men, the descendants of the Beornings and the men of Dale.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Mirkwood'' is an English name, which means \"gloomy wood\".

It was the site of a great battle, and afterwards was known as [[Withered Heath]].<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n''Mirkwood'' is the Anglicized form of the Norse name ''[[wikipedia:Myrkviðr|Myrkviðr]]'' or ''mirkiwidu'', originally hailing from [[Poetic Edda|Eddaic poems]]. Myrkviðr was the name of a \"dark boundary-forest ... the great forest that divided the land of the Goths from the land of the Huns\".<ref>{{HM|SG}}, pp. 131, 227-8, 372</ref> In a letter to his grandson Michael, Tolkien wrote that the name \"''Mirkwood'' was not his invention but was probably the Primitive Germanic name of the great mountainous forest regions that anciently formed a barrier to the south of the lands of Germanic expansions and in some traditions became used especially for the boundary between Goths and Huns. He then continues to discuss the origin of the name in very early German ''mirkiwidu'' writings.<ref name=L289/>\n\nProjected into Old English, the term appears as ''Myrcwudu'' in Tolkien's ''[[The Lost Road]]'', as a poem sung by [[Ælfwine]]:<ref>{{HM|LR}}: \"The Lost Road: (iii) The unwritten chapters\": ''[[King Sheave]]'' and note to line 150</ref>\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nSea-danes and Goths, Swedes and Northmen,\nFranks and Frisians, folk of the islands,\nSwordmen and Saxons, Swabes and English,\nand the Langobards who long ago\nbeyond Myrcwudu a mighty realm\nand wealth won them in the Welsh countries\nwhere Ælfwine Eadwine's heir\nin Italy was king.

The announced goal is to saw chaos into Orc forces by destroying as many of their troops, weapons and supplies as possible, to delay an inevitable assault upon Lothlorien. The true purpose, however, is to distract the Eye of Sauron from the company departing down the shores of Anduin. An assault by the Golden Host of the Galadhrim is successful despite minor losses and after establishing multiple camps throughout southern Mirkwood arrives at the walls of the fortress itself. However, without the White Lady they do not have the means of bringing down the walls, so the Elves prepare to swiftly fall back beyond Anduin before the main forces of the Enemy arrive.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Mirkwood is the setting of one the missions in the game, where [[Eradan]], [[Farin]] and [[Andriel]] have to rescue [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] from a giant spider.\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Mirkwood is featured in the [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|second Hobbit film]], with its scenes being shot both on set in the studio and on location.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)]]\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Forests]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[de:Düsterwald]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/forets/rhovanion/foret noire]]\n[[fi:Synkmetsä]]",

Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!<br>West Wind blew there; light upon the Silver Tree...|[[Aragorn]] in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Riders of Rohan]]\"}}</center>\n\n'''Gondor''', or the '''South-kingdom''', was one of the two [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]] (the other being [[Arnor]] in the north) in the lands about the [[Mouths of Anduin]]. Initially the lesser of the [[Realms in Exile|Realms in-Exile]], Gondor survived to the end of the [[Third Age]], unlike [[Arnor]], and had an instrumental role in the [[War of the Ring]].\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\n====Foundation====\nAfter the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the [[Exiles of Númenor]], led by [[Elendil]], established the [[Realms in Exile]] of [[Arnor]] and Gondor. Arriving at the [[Mouths of Anduin]], Elendil's sons, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], ascended the great river and founded the realm of Gondor.<ref name=\"rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref> \n\nIn [[Númenor]]ean colonies and outposts, such as [[Belfalas]] and [[Pelargir]],<ref name=\"UTD\">{{UT|Druedain}}</ref> there were many [[Faithful]], fully or partially of [[Númenórean]] blood, who descended from [[Númenor]] long before its [[Downfall of Numenor|Downfall]]. The colonists welcomed Elendil's sons and allied themselves with the founders of the [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]].<ref name=\"rings\" /><ref name=\"languages\">{{App|Men}}</ref> Elendil made the Faithful nobles (kin of Elendil) who ruled Belfalas \"[[Princes of Dol Amroth|Princes]]\".<ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> There were also many men of mingled blood, descended from the [[Men of the Mountains|Men of]] the [[White Mountains]] during the [[Dark Years]].<ref name=\"Minas Tirith\">{{RK|V1}}</ref> \n\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - The White Tree.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The White Tree'']]\n\nAt this early point in its history, Gondor was the lesser of the Kingdoms of the Dúnedain, with their conjoint [[King of Gondor|Kings]] subject to the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] who ruled [[Arnor]] in the North. After their arrival and acceptance by the people, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] put themselves to the task of ordering their realm. Isildur took the area then known as [[Arnen]] (later [[Ithilien]])<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 17</ref> and built the tower of [[Minas Ithil]] near Mordor as a threat to the [[Mordor|Black Land]], and within its walls he planted a seedling of the [[Nimloth of Númenor|White Tree]] of [[Númenor]] that he had taken before its burning. [[Anárion]] raised the tower of [[Minas Anor]] on the other side of [[Anduin]]'s floodplain as a bulwark against the [[Wild Men]]. In between their cities, the brothers founded [[Osgiliath]], their capital, from which they jointly reigned; these three cities also housed three of the [[palantíri]], the Seeing Stones that the [[Faithful]] had taken with them from [[Númenor]], to maintain contact with [[Elendil]] and the other areas under their control.\n\nExtraordinary knowledge of stonework was brought to the South-kingdom from [[Númenor]], and this skill was a vital part of the character of Gondor and its people. In the early years of the realm, the [[Gondorians]] worked to erect mighty cities and monuments throughout their new land.<ref name=\"rings\" /> Their original capital at [[Osgiliath]] had great stone bridges spanned the [[Anduin]], as well as mighty houses and towers of stone.<ref name=\"rings\" /> Other works marvellous and strong they built in the land in the days of their power, at the [[Argonath]], and at [[Aglarond]], and at [[Erech]]; and at [[Isengard]], they made the [[Orthanc|Pinnacle of Orthanc]] of unbreakable stone.<ref name=\"rings\" /> Great roads that ran both north and south of the [[White Mountains]] traversed through the realm.<ref name=\"RotR\" />\n\nGondor was, from the beginnning of its history, always more powerful and populous than its northern counterpart, [[Arnor]], in spite of its borders being impeded in the South and East.<ref name=\"Atani\">{{PM|Atani}}</ref>\n\n====War of the Last Alliance====\n{{main|War of the Last Alliance}}\nGondor was at first unaware that [[Sauron]], who had been taken as a prisoner to [[Númenor]] before its destruction, had survived the disastrous [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]]. However, not long after the kingdom's cities were built, the awakening of the fires of [[Orodruin]] signalled his return. At that time, the [[Men of Gondor]] first called the mountain ''[[Amon Amarth]]'', or [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>\n\nSoon after, in {{SA|3429}}, [[Sauron]] launched an [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|attack on Minas Ithil]], which forced [[Isildur]] into a retreat. Sauron took the fortress and burned the [[White Tree of Gondor]] that had grown there, but Isildur saved one of its seedlings and took it and his family on a ship down the [[Anduin]]. He sailed to the north to confer with [[Elendil]] about these events while [[Anárion]] remained in Gondor and continued to hold [[Minas Anor]] and [[Osgiliath]].<ref>{{App|B1}}</ref> He also managed to push back [[Sauron]]'s forces to the mountain range of [[Ephel Dúath]], but Sauron began to gather reinforcements and the [[Men of Gondor]] knew that their realm was in great danger of being destroyed unless aid came.\n\n[[Elendil]] reacted to the threat of Sauron by combining forces with [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], to make the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. Their armies marched south-east from [[Arnor]] and [[Lindon]]. Supported by the forces of Gondor, [[Lórinand]], the [[Woodland Realm]], and [[Khazad-dûm]], the [[Last Alliance|Alliance]] fought a great battle on the plain of [[Dagorlad]], north of [[Mordor]]. The [[Last Alliance]] was victorious, and entered [[Mordor]] itself, where they laid a siege on Sauron's Tower of [[Siege of Barad-dûr|Barad-dûr]] for seven years. During this time, [[Anárion]], joint [[King of Gondor]], was killed by a rock thrown from [[Barad-dûr]] that broke his helm. The siege ended when [[Sauron]] himself emerged from [[Barad-dûr]] to fight the [[Last Alliance|Alliance]]. [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]] were slain in single combat, but [[Isildur]] cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's finger ending the war.<ref name=\"rings\" />\n\n===Third Age===\n====Independence====\nAfter the battle, [[Isildur]], former joint [[King of Gondor]] and heir to the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High Kingship]],  built a secret tomb for [[Elendil]] on the mountain [[Amon Anwar]]<ref name=\"Cirion\" /> and placed the rule of Gondor in the hands of his brother's eldest eligible son, [[Meneldil]]. Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree that he had saved in [[Minas Ithil]], and brought to Minas Anor, and it endured for several centuries. \n\nAfter these acts, Isildur left Gondor in {{TA|2}} with the intent of taking up the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High Kingship]] in [[Annúminas]]. He [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|never arrived]].<ref name=\"rings\" /><ref name=\"AppB2\" /> [[Isildur]] had relinquished the rule of Gondor to his nephew [[Meneldil]] who became the first [[King of Gondor]] to rule in his own right and so, Gondor became an independent realm.<ref name=\"rings\" /><ref name=\"AppB2\" />\n\n====Golden Age====\nAfter the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted by an [[Easterlings|Easterling]] invasion in {{TA|492}}). Its power would continue to grow into the 9th century of the [[Third Age]].  While the power of Gondor's sister kingdom [[Arnor]] peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various successor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come.\n[[File:Steven White Jr. - Gondor TA1050.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gondor in {{TA|1050}}]]\nGondor's power reached its Golden Age under the four \"[[Ship-kings]]\": [[Tarannon Falastur]], [[Eärnil I]], [[Ciryandil]], and [[Hyarmendacil I]].\n\nTarannon was [[Captain of the Hosts]] and the first of the [[Ship-kings]] of Gondor, who extended Gondor far along the shores west and south of the [[Ethir Anduin]]. Commemorating his victories, Tarannon assumed the name \"Falastur\" when he took the crown.<ref name=\"AppGondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Tarannon was also famous for his Queen, the \"nefarious, solitary, and loveless\" [[Berúthiel]].  Tarannon had built a house in [[Pelargir]] that rested upon arches sunk into the [[Anduin]], but the queen refused to live within the sound and smell of the sea.  She lived in the King's House in [[Osgiliath]] where she owned cats said to be able to spy upon men. Eventually Tarannon placed her upon a boat cast adrift at sea.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, Note 7</ref>  He was then the first king to die without an heir, and was succeeded by his nephew, the second of the Ship-kings, [[Eärnil I]].<ref name=\"South\" />\n\n[[Eärnil I]] continued with the expansionist maritime policy of his predecessor by constructing a great navy and repairing the ancient haven of [[Pelargir]].<ref name=\"Elendil\" /> But Gondor was not the supreme \"Lord of the Coasts\" as Tarannon boasted; the [[Haven of Umbar]] stood in their way of complete domination.  So in {{TA|933}}, [[Eärnil I]] defeated the forces of Umbar, seizing control of the seas and making Umbar a great harbour and fortress of Gondor. Even though Gondor's naval power was uncontested, [[Eärnil I]] was lost at sea and was never seen again. \n\nWhen he was lost at sea, he was succeeded by his son [[Ciryandil]], who continued his father's naval policies of building more ships. Ciryandil reigned over Gondor for seventy-nine years, and died in the defence of Umbar against the Haradrim, in Haradwaith, led by the lords exiled from Umbar.\n\nWhen Ciryandil was slain, his son Ciryaher took up the Crown. After biding his time and building up his forces, he avenged his father, and defeated the kings of Harad, by land and by sea and   made  them   acknowledge  the   overlordship of Gondor in {{TA|1050}}. After this victory he took the name ''Hyarmendacil'', meaning \"South-victor\". In the reign of the powerful king Hyarmendacil I Gondor reached the height of its power. Hyarmendacil's reign brought Gondor to its greatest extent and power. For the rest of his one hundred and thirty-four year reign Gondor was at peace; the passes of [[Mordor]] were well guarded, and no one dared contest his power. During Hyarmendacil I's reign, Gondor's borders reached their furthest extent. The Kingdom extended east to the [[Sea of Rhûn]]; south to the [[Harnen]] and all the coast up to the cape of [[Umbar]]; as far north as [[Celebrant]]; and west towards [[Greyflood]]. Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of peace due to its military might. The [[Men of the Vales of Anduin]] as well as the Haradrim acknowledged its authority and overlordship, with the Kings of Harad paying homage.<ref name=\"AppGondor\" /> Hyarmendacil I was the last of the [[Ship-kings]]. He was succeeded by his lazy son [[Atanatar II|Atanatar II Alcarin]].\n\n====Decline====\nThe extent and power of the realm Atanatar had inherited earned him the title [[Alcarin]] (\"Glorious\") but he did little to maintain its strength, and nothing to expand its influence. Already during Atanatar's reign, then, Gondor began to stagnate. There is some evidence to suggest that [[Gandalf]] first visited Gondor during this period, earning the name ''[[Incánus]]'' from the [[Gondorians]]. Atanatar II ruled Gondor for seventy-seven years, during which the wealth and power created by his father slowly began to wane. Atanatar was succeeded by his eldest son, who ruled as [[Narmacil I]], but [[Narmacil]] had no children and was succeeded in turn by his brother, Atanatar's younger son [[Calmacil]].\n\nAfter sixty-four years as [[Regent of Gondor|Regent]] under the old King [[Calmacil]], [[Minalcar]] took the throne in his own right. In memory of a great victory over the [[Easterlings]] he had won in his [[Regent of Gondor|Regency]], he became King in the name [[Rómendacil II]]. [[Rómendacil II]] built, on the northern approach to [[Nen Hithoel]], the giant pillars [[Argonath]] to mark the northern border of Gondor following his great victory over the [[Easterlings]] in {{TA|1248}}.<ref name=\"AppB2\">{{App|B2}}</ref> He developed less tangible defences, too, working to cement a bond between Gondor and the [[Northmen]] who lived to the east. He went so far as to send his son [[Valacar]] to live among them, an act from which the evils of the [[Kin-strife]] would eventually develop. After Rómendacil II's reign, decadence spread under the kings of Gondor and a long period of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals). Three great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the Third Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline:  the [[Kin-strife]], the [[Great Plague]], and the invasion of the [[Wainriders]] (a tribe of Easterlings), one of series of conflicts in the [[Wainrider/Balchoth War]].  \n\n=====Kin-strife=====\n{{main|Kin-strife}}\nIn the 15th century a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the nation apart.  The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother was of the Northmen.  Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of King Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's naval forces who possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain, and Eldacar fled north.  Castamir was afterwards known as [[Castamir|Castamir the Usurper]].  During his ten year rule he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of his old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the interior provinces were ignored and left to rot.  Eldacar then returned with an army of his Northmen kinsmen, and they were joined by armies of Gondorians from interior provinces such as Anórien.  [[Osgiliath]] was devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but Castamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great port of Gondor.  They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined with the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their descendants died out.\n\n=====Great Plague=====\n{{main|Great Plague}}\nIn [[Third Age 1636]], the [[Great Plague]] struck and the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] died. This Plague was no localized event:  the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth, reaching the successor states of Arnor and the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] in the North. King [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]] found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved the capital from Osgiliath to [[Minas Anor]], the City of Anárion. During this time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding against the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned.  They were slow to recover; but their weakness was not tested for a long time. No doubt the people further east had been equally afflicted, so that the enemies of Gondor came chiefly from the south or over sea.<ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>\n\n=====Invasion of the Wainriders=====\nThe first invasion of the Wainriders began {{TA|1856}} during the reign of King [[Narmacil II]], following the sapping of Gondor's strength by the plague.  The spirit of Sauron in the East stirred up the forces of the Wainriders to attack the lands of Gondor and her allies. The Wainriders were stronger than any other horde of Easterlings before, and so in 1856, on the fields of Rhovanion, the Wainriders defeated the forces of Gondor and the Northmen, killing [[Narmacil II]] and enslaving Rhovanion.  During the enslavement of Rhovannion, the Nazgûl entered Mordor.  But the Gondorians would not sit idle, while their allies to the north were suffering under the Wainriders.  In 1899 King Calimehtar led a revolt in Rhovanion, and defeated the Wainriders in the Battle of Dagorlad.  \n\n{{TA|1940}} The King [[Ondoher]] took council with [[Araphant]] the king of [[Arthedain]]. The kings realized that one force was beset on destroying the kingdoms of the [[Dunedain]].  For a long time it had lain dormant, but in the weakness of both kingdoms, it attacked.  The Kingdoms allied against the power, and Prince [[Arvedui]] of Arthedain married Firiel the daughter of Ondoher.  \n\nAfter licking their wounds for 45 years the Wainriders returned with allies from Khand and Harad in {{TA|1944}}. The Wainriders came in the north from Rhovanion and the men of Harad and Khand attacked from the South.  The Wainriders destroyed the Northern Army of Gondor, but in the south Gondor defeated the Southrons at the River Poros.  Their Captain Eärnil gathered the remnants of the northern army, and went north to challenge the Wainriders. In the [[Battle of the Camp]] Eärnil surprised the Wainriders, while they were celebrating their victory.\n\n=====Reunification Rejected=====\nIn 1944, Gondor also faced a constitutional crisis when King [[Ondoher]] was slain in a previous battle with both his sons. Prince [[Arvedui]], son of King [[Araphant]] of [[Arthedain]] and Ondoher's son-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant blood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay mainly in the reintroduction of the old Númenórean law of accession, which stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If the law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's wife [[Fíriel]], Ondoher's daughter and last remaining child would become [[Ruling Queens of Númenor|Ruling Queen]], making their descendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put weight behind his claim as he was Isildur's heir. The Council of Gondor recognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but they dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of Anárion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a millennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of both Isildur and Anárion.\n\nEärnil lay his claim as being a direct descendant of King [[Telumehtar]] Umbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he had gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the Wainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward [[Pelendur]] who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of succession, intervened in favour of Gondor's victorious general who would rule as [[Eärnil II]].\n\n=====Last Heir of Anárion=====\nDuring the [[Battle of Fornost]], Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's forces to victory over the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]], who was actually the Lord of the [[Nazgûl]].  Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse was terrified and fled the battle against his wishes.  By the time he mastered his horse and return, the Witch-king had fled.  [[Glorfindel]] the Elf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord of the Nazgûl because \"never by the hand of man shall he fall\".  \n\nEärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (Tower of the Sun).  During this time, the Ringwraiths [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|captured]] Minas Anor's sister city, Minas Ithil (Tower of the Moon), causing it to be renamed Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery), and took it as their lair.  Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard) as a result.  The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly sent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat, taunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during the Battle of Fornost.  Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and rode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the challenge.  They were never heard from again.  So ended the Line of [[Anárion]].\n\n====Ruling Stewards of Gondor====\n{{main|Ruling Stewards}}\nThe realm was governed by a long line of hereditary Stewards after the disappearance of [[Eärnur]], son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that the last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be accepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed, and Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would surely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would swear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only an heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor there was no one who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the northern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not considered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without having the title.\n\n=====Cirion and Eorl=====\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - The oath of Cirion and Eorl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The oath of Cirion and Eorl'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nIn [[Third Age 2510]], when Steward [[Cirion]] ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one of its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the ''[[Balchoth]]'' invaded Gondor with massive force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but were cut off from [[Minas Tirith]] and pushed back in the direction of the [[Limlight]].\n\nMessengers were sent to get help from the [[Éothéod]], a tribe which lived in the northern vales of the [[Anduin]], but nobody expected the messengers to reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor, however, the Éothéod turned the tide of the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]]. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of [[Calenardhon]] north of the [[Ered Nimrais]] from the Gap of Rohan at the southern end of the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]], [[Fangorn Forest]], rivers Limlight to river [[Anduin]], western [[Emyn Muil]] and the [[Mering Stream]], where they established the kingdom of [[Rohan]] with [[Eorl the Young]] as their first king. A perpetual alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath Eorl swore to Cirion.<ref name=\"Cirion\" />\n\nIn {{TA|2710}} King [[Déor]] asked the help of [[Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Egalmoth]] to drive off the [[Dunlendings]] from the occupied [[Ring of Isengard]], but a renewed war against the Orcs prevented the Steward from fulfilling the Oath.<ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>\n\nSouthern Gondor was assailed by three great fleets from Umbar and Harad and [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Beren]] spent much of his rule fighting the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. In the meantime, during the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2758}} - {{TA|2759|n}}, Rohan came under attack from the Dunlendings, so neither nation could help the other, until captain Beregond, Beren's son, repeled the invaders. Therefore when [[Saruman]] suddenly appeared and requested leave to dwell in [[Isengard]], Beren gladly gave the [[Wizard]] the [[key of Orthanc]]. By the time of Beregond, Gondor started recovering its strength.<ref name=\"Stewards\">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n\nUpon the death of [[Belecthor II|Belecthor]], the [[White Tree of Gondor]] also died, but was left standing \"until the King comes\".<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 206</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2885}}, when Ithilien was invaded in great strength, King [[Folcwine]] of Rohan fulfilled the Oath and sent many men to Gondor. With their aid Steward [[Túrin II]] won a victory at the [[Crossings of Poros]]. Since then, Gondor withdrew from Ithilien and only the [[Rangers of Ithilien]] remained with special refuges for them, and a fortification on Cair Andros.<ref name=\"AppGondor\" />\n\nIt was near the end of [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Turgon]]'s rule, in  {{TA|2951}}, when [[Sauron]] declared himself openly in [[Mordor]]; he gathered his power there, and began rebuilding [[Barad-dûr]].<ref name=\"AppB2\" /> [[Ecthelion II]] strengthened [[Pelargir]] and refortified [[Cair Andros]].<ref name=\"Elendil\" /> Under his service, the stranger [[Thorongil]], severely damaged the Corsairs' fleet at Umbar in a [[Surprise Attack on Umbar|surprise attack]].<ref name=\"Stewards\" />\n\n=====War of the Ring=====\n{{main|War of the Ring}}\n[[File:Steven White Jr. - Gondor TA3019.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gondor in {{TA|3019}}]]\nIn 3019, during the [[War of the Ring]], Gondor was the strongest of the free nations that opposed Sauron, and thus, its defeat was his primary strategic goal in the war.<ref name=\"Minas Tirith\">{{RK|V1}}</ref>  Gondor faced an all out attack on its capital Minas Tirith in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. Although nearly defeated, the Rohirrim once again turned the tide of battle, and helped win the war, though with heavy losses.<ref name=\"tBotPF\">{{RK|Battle}}</ref> The combined army of the West then carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the allies' ultimate victory.\n\n===Later history===\n{{main|Reunited Kingdom}}\nAfter the second and final defeat of Sauron, the [[King of Gondor|Kingship of Gondor]] was restored, [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] became the third [[King of Gondor and Arnor]]. \n\nDuring his reign, [[Aragorn]] restored Gondor and repeopled it, but retained [[Minas Tirith]] as the chief city.<ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> He, alongside [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Éomer]], led military campaigns beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and on the far fields of the [[South]].<ref name=\"Appendix A\">{{App|Mark}}</ref> As a result, he was able to re-establish his dominance in places which Gondor initially held at the height of its power.

In all debatable matters of importance domestic, or external, however, even [[Denethor II|Denethor]] had a [[Council of Gondor|Council]], and at least listened to what the Lords of the Fiefs and the Captains of the Forces had to say. [[Aragorn]] re-established the [[Council of Gondor|Great Council of Gondor]], and in that [[Faramir]], who remained by inheritance the [[Steward]] (or representative of the King during his absence abroad, or sickness, or between his death and the accession of his heir) was his chief counsellor.<ref name=\"politics\">{{L|244}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAt its greatest extent, the realm extended:<ref name=\"AppGondor\" />\n\n*North to the [[Field of Celebrant]] and the southern eaves of [[Mirkwood]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\" />\n*West to the [[Greyflood]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\" />\n*East to the inland [[Sea of Rhûn]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\" />\n*South to the [[River Harnen]], and also along the coast to the peninsula and haven of [[Umbar]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\" />\n\n[[Calenardhon|A large part of the northern territories]] was gifted to the [[Éothéod]] in {{TA|2510}}.<ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> Gondor's close proximity to Sauron's land was the catalyst of many battles and skirmishes, but its location also gave the Gondorians more ability to protect the other regions of Middle-earth from the Dark Lord and his servants.<ref name=\"CoE\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nAt the height  of its  power, between  the reigns of  [[Hyarmendacil I]]  and [[Rómendacil II]] ({{TA|1015}}-{{TA|1366|n}}), the wide lands between [[Anduin]] and  the  [[Sea of Rhûn]]  were  never  effectively  settled  or  occupied,  and  the  only  true north  boundary of the  Kingdom  east  of  [[Anduin]]  was  formed  by   the  [[Emyn Muil]]  and the   marshes   south   and   east   of   them.<ref name=\"Atani\" /> Númenorean influence, however,   went  far   beyond  even   these  extended   bounds,  passing up  the  [[Vales of Anduin]]  to  its  sources,  and  reaching  the lands east  of  [[Mirkwood]],  between  the  [[River Running]] and the [[River Carnen]].<ref name=\"Atani\" />\n\n===Regions===\nGondor was divided between several nearly autonomous regions.

An antique, more formal and terse, form of the Common Tongue was spoken by the Gondorians.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref> \n\nMany of the Men of Gondor could also speak the [[Elvish]] tongues, a notable distinction and characteristic among the [[Dúnedain of the South]].<ref name=\"languages\" /> [[Sindarin]] had long ceased to be a \"first language\" in Gondor, but was learned in early youth (by those claiming [[Númenórean]] descent) from loremasters, and used by them as a mark of rank and high-blood.<ref name=\"Elendil\" /> It had changed very little since the [[Downfall of Númenor]] and though the [[Men of Gondor]] altered some of the sounds, they could still understand the [[Elves]] and be understood by them.<ref name=\"Elendil\" /> [[Westron]] became used more and more by the [[Dúnedain of Gondor]] themselves, so that at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Sindarin]] was known to only a small part of the peoples of Gondor (and spoken daily by fewer); they dwelt mostly in [[Minas Tirith]] and the adjacent townlands, and in the land of the tributary princes of [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name=\"languages\" /> [[Sindarin]] was used to be polite, especially in [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\"quenya\">{{L|347}}</ref>\n\n[[Quenya]] was known to the learned of Gondor, a tradition which has continued from the loremasters of [[Númenor]], to be used for places of fame and reverence in addition to the names of royalty and men of great renown.<ref name=\"languages\" /><ref name=\"quenya\" /> All the royal names of the [[Kings of Gondor]] as well as all the [[Stewards]] until [[Mardil Voronwë]] were [[Quenya]] names.<ref name=\"languages\" /><ref name=\"South\">{{App|South}}</ref> At the end of the [[Third Age]], there were more [[Gondorians]] (those of [[Minas Tirith]] and its fiefs) that knew [[Quenya]] or spoke [[Sindarin]] than there were [[Elves]] (those of [[Lindon]], [[Rivendell]], and [[Lórien]]) who did either.<ref name=\"quenya\" /> \n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Gondor.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe name '''''Gondor''''' was likely adopted from the lesser people's terminology<ref name=\"L324\">{{L|324}}</ref> and translates from [[Sindarin]] as \"Stone-land\", from the words ''[[gond]]'' (\"stone\") + ''(n)[[dor]]'' (\"land\").<ref name=\"L324\" /> Gondor received its name because of the abundance of stone in the [[Ered Nimrais]], and the usage of it in great stone cities, statues, and monuments, such as Minas Tirith and the Argonath. \n\n==Other names==\nIts [[Quenya]] name was '''''Ondonórë'''''.<ref name=\"PE17\">{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Gondor''', p. 28</ref><ref name=\"VT42\">{{VT|42}}, entry ''Belfalas'', p. 27</ref> \n\nIn earlier times, it was called the ''Hyaralondië'' (''Hyallondië'') or in full ''Turmen Hyallondiéva'' in Quenya, and ''Arthor na Challonnas'' (\"Realm of the South-harbourage\") in Sindarin: the elements ''[[londië]]'' and ''[[lonnas]]'' mean \"harbour, landing\".<ref name=\"PE17\" />\n\nGondor was also referred to as the Kingdom of the South,<ref>{{UT|Eorl}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Tradition}}</ref> the South Kingdom,<ref name=\"rings\" /><ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 252</ref><ref>{{UT|11c}}</ref> South-kingdom<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref><ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2, p. 1085</ref><ref>{{RK|Muster}}, p. 803</ref><ref>{{RK|Battle}}, p. 849</ref> or the Southern Realm.<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Rohan]], it was known as '''Stoningland''' (a modernization of [[Old English]] ''Stāning-(land)''<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Stoningland''', p. 776</ref>),<ref name=\"tBotPF\" /> and [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] of the [[Drúedain]] also recognized their use of stone.<ref name=\"RotR\">{{RK|Ride}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe history and civilization of Gondor has been compared to historical elements of the real world. Many real-world civilizations experienced periods in which a regent, vizier, or or general held actual power in the name a rightful monarch, like the Ruling Stewards did in Gondor. In his letters Tolkien compared the Ruling Stewards of Gondor to the Carolingians of France—Charlemagne's line descended from a marshal in service to the Merovingian dynasty that eventually replaced them.\n===Italy===\n[[Letter to Jennifer Brookes-Smith (28 July 1955)|Writing in a letter]] about an impending trip in [[1955]], Tolkien identified Gondor as [[Wikipedia:Italy|Italy]].<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 462</ref>\n===Egypt===\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in a [[Letter 211|letter]] that the Númenóreans of Gondor resembled Egyptians in many ways, including their love of, and ability to construct, the gigantic and massive, and in their interest in ancestry and tombs. He also thought that the [[Crown of Gondor]] was very tall and similar to the [[Wikipedia:Pschent|crown of the Pharaohs of Egypt]], but with attached wings that were set back at an angle.<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 281</ref> [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] pointed out that the [[Argonath]], two gigantic statues of [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], recall ancient Egyptian statues, like the [[Wikipedia:Colossi of Memnon|two gigantic statues of Memnon]] at the [[Wikipedia:Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III|Mortuary Temple of Amenophis III]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 347</ref> They also referred to this letter in a [[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion|comment]] concerning [[Faramir]]'s statement that \"Kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 477</ref> Notably, some \"scholars\" claimed that ancient Egypt was a colony of [[Wikipedia:Atlantis|Atlantis]],<ref>[[Wikipedia:Ignatius L. Donnelly|Ignatius L. Donnelly]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4032 Atlantis: The Antediluvian World] (1882), Part V, Chapter II: The Egyptian Colony</ref> much like how Gondor was a survival of Númenor (although it is unknown if Tolkien considered this aspect).\n\n===Byzantine Empire===\nThe subdivision of the Númenórean realms in exile into a northwestern kingdom of Arnor and a southeastern kingdom of Gondor resembles the subdivision of the Roman Empire into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire). Like Gondor survived Arnor and its successor kingdoms, the Byzantine Empire long survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire and had periods of glory. Like the kin-strife in Gondor there were civil-wars among the members of the ruling families in the Byzantine Empire.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 689</ref>\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] stated in a long [[letter to Milton Waldman]] that was probably written in late 1951, in which he summarized the story of ''The Silmarillion'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', that in the Third Age Gondor rises to a peak and then \"fades slowly to decayed Middle-Age, a kind of proud, venerable, but increasingly impotent Byzantium\"<ref>{{L|131}}</ref> and that the story in Book Five reaches the \"half-ruinous Byzantine City of Minas Tirith\"<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 746</ref>. Some of the parallels noted between Gondor and the Byzantine Empire are:<ref>Miryam Librán-Moreno, \"'Byzantium, New Rome!': Goths, Langobards, and Byzantium in ''The Lord of the Rings''\", in ''[[Tolkien and the Study of His Sources]]'' (edited by [[Jason Fisher]]</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Tom Simon|articleurl=https://bondwine.com/2010/03/13/gondor-byzantium-and-feudalism/|articlename=Gondor, Byzantium, and feudalism|dated=13 March 2010|website=[http://www.bondwine.com/ Bondwine]|accessed=26 November 2024}}</ref>\n\nGondor is the south-eastern portion of [[Elendil]]'s original kingdom. The Byzantine Empire was the eastern remnant of the Roman Empire. The [[Wikipedia:Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire]] eventually withered and dissolved, like [[Arnor]], while the Byzantine Empire endured, although in a dramatically weakened state. Both states acted as a cultural and military buffer between two cultures: Byzantium between Europe and Islam, Gondor between the northern polities and Mordor. The Byzantine Empire absorbed several \"barbaric\" peoples like the Wends and Slavs, much like Gondor did with the [[Northmen]] and other [[Middle Men]]. Unlike Byzantium, Gondor did not fall and was restored through the return of its rightful line of kings. Constantinople and Minas Tirith also play similar roles as the respective largest cities in their respective cultural spheres.\n\nAs a final note, the last Byzantine Emperor, [[Wikipedia:Constantine XI Palaiologos#Legacy|Constantine XI]], remained in legend and folklore as the [[Wikipedia:King in the mountain|\"Marble Emperor\"]] whose messianic ressurection and return would signal the restoration of the Empire. This parallels the fate of [[Earnur]] and Gondor's interregnum period until the \"Return of the [[Aragorn|King]]\" who [[Reunited Kingdom|restored the Kingdom]].\n\n{{references}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n[[Category:Gondor| ]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Gondor]]\n[[fi:Gondor]]",

It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the [[Emyn Muil]].|''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Riders of Rohan]]\"}}\n'''Rohan''' was a [[Men|Mannish]] kingdom on the northern borders of [[Gondor]]. It was the territory of the [[Rohirrim]], a people of herdsmen and farmers. Well-known for their [[horses]] and cavalry, they were Gondor's most important ally. \n\n==Description==\nThe borders of Rohan were the River [[Isen]] from its junction with the [[Adorn]] and then northwards to the outer walls of [[Isengard]] and the Adorn in the west; from the outer walls of Isengard eastwards and northwards along the eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]] to the [[Limlight]] in the north; the river [[Anduin]] and the west-cliff of the [[Emyn Muil]] hills down to the marshes of the mouths of the [[Entwash]] and beyond those marshes the [[Mering Stream|Mering stream]] that flowed from the Wood of Anwar to join the Entwash in the east and the [[White Mountains]] as far as the end of their northward arm in the south.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (iii) Cirion and Eorl, paragraph with the footnotes 45 and 46 and the following paragraph</ref><ref>{{RK|Map}}, red dotted line with the label \"Border of Rohan\"</ref>\n\nThe most significant feature of Rohan's geography was the river Entwash, which divided the country between [[Eastemnet]] and [[Westemnet]], itself divided as [[Eastfold]] and [[Westfold]]. Other lands were [[the Wold]], the [[Folde]], the line of downs to the north-west of the [[East Wall of Rohan]]<ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref> and the [[Undeeps]].\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Riders of Rohan.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Riders of Rohan'']]\nThe Rohirrim found abandoned Gondorian fortresses and refuges in the White Mountains, such as [[Dunharrow]], [[Orthanc]] and the [[Hornburg]] which they restored and used themselves. \n\nThe capital of Rohan was the hill fort of [[Edoras]] which lay on the slopes of the [[White Mountains]]. Another large city was [[Aldburg]], the capital city of the Eastfold and original city of [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]]. Other cities must have existed but are not named.\n\n===Climate and countryside===\nThe countryside of Rohan was described as a land of pastures and lush tall grassland. The lands of Rohan are frequently described as appearing like \"seas of grass\". Most of the Rohirrim dwelt in small villages or farms.\n\n==Background==\nIn the 1200s of the [[Third Age]], the [[Kings of Gondor]] made close alliances with the [[Northmen]] of [[Rhovanion]], a people akin to the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses of the Edain]] (later the [[Dúnedain]]) from the [[First Age]]. In the 2000s, a remnant tribe of such Northmen that called itself the [[Éothéod]] moved from the valleys of [[Anduin]] to the north-west of [[Mirkwood]], clearing out what remained of the recently defeated Witch-kingdom of [[Angmar]], east of the [[Misty Mountains]].  \n\nIn the meantime, the Gondorian province of [[Calenardhon]] was deserted by the [[Great Plague]] and during the [[Watchful Peace]], local chieftains, such as [[Dunlendings]] gained control.<ref name=\"isen\">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> During the time of [[Cirion]] the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]], Calenardhon was overrun by the [[Balchoth]].\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl]]\nIn {{TA|2509|n}}, Cirion sent summons to the Éothéod for aid in stopping a combined invasion of Men from the north-east of [[Middle-earth]], and [[Orcs]] from the Misty Mountains. [[Borondir]] reached [[Eorl the Young]], king of the Éothéod, who answered the summons, and arrived unexpectedly at a decisive [[battle of the Field of Celebrant]].\n\nAs a reward, Cirion invited Eorl on [[Amon Anwar]], over the [[tomb of Elendil]], and he swore mutual alliance and cooperation between the two peoples. The Steward also gave Eorl the deserted but fertile area of Calenardhon to take as their own and repopulate.\n\n==History==\n[[Eorl]] moved his people there driving out the [[Dunlendings]] who attempted to repopulate it without [[Gondor]]'s consent. Eorl also built the first city of Rohan, [[Aldburg]]. Eorl lost his life fighting the [[Easterlings]] in the [[The Wold|Wold]].<ref name=\"mark\">{{App|Mark}}</ref> Migration was continued to the days of second king [[Brego]], who defended the borders against the Dunlendings and Easterlings and drove the remaining [[Orcs]] and [[Balchoth]] off the Wold. Brego also built the Golden Hall of [[Meduseld]], and made [[Edoras]] the capital of Rohan.\n\n[[File:Jan Pospisil - Edoras.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Pospisil]] - ''Edoras'']]\nKing [[Aldor]] was the founder of a golden age in Rohan's history, during which he completed Rohan's conquest east of the [[Isen]] and the [[Rohirrim]] increased greatly in numbers, and even settled valleys of [[Ered Nimrais]] including [[Harrowdale]]. It was he who succeeded in driving all the remaining Dunlendings from his realm. Rohan continued to prosper during [[Goldwine]]'s rule; but as the guard of the borders lessened, the Dunlendings slowly began to return to northern [[Westfold]], settling the area around the (friendly to them) [[Ring of Isengard]] and the southern eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref name=\"isen\" /> A powerful Dunlendish force had been established, and King [[Déor]] was forced to ride northward from Edoras, ultimately to defeat his enemies but he was unable to recapture the Ring of Isengard. The following years the Dunlendings harassed and mingled with the Rohirrim.\n\nThe first line of kings lasted for 249 years, until the ninth king [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]. In {{TA|2758}}, Rohan was invaded by Dunlendings under [[Wulf]], son of [[Freca]], of mixed Dunland and Rohan blood. The King, Helm Hammerhand, took refuge in the Hornburg until reinforcements from Gondor and Dunharrow (a refuge of the Rohirrim) arrived a year later and defeated the invaders. In a daring raid [[Fréaláf]] recaptured Edoras, and managed to reclaim it. He eventually drove the Dunlendings back across the rivers Isen and [[Adorn]], freeing all of Rohan. It would take Rohan close to 200 years to recover its strength after the invasion. \n\nThe Rohirrim now kept a strong force in north Westfold, however at some time King [[Folcwine]] would need the help of Gondor to drive some of them from the area.<ref name=\"mark\" /> He was successful but the people who remained were largely of mixed blood, and not loyal to Edoras.<ref name=\"isen\" />\n\nSoon after this, [[Saruman]] arrived and took over Isengard. He was welcomed as a strong ally. \n\nAs Rohan was still recovering from the war with the Dunlendings, hostilities remained at the western borders. For two generations during the [[War of Dwarves and Orcs]], many thousands of [[Orcs]] sought refuge in the [[White Mountains]] and troubled the Rohirrim. King [[Brytta]] fought them off, and when he died it was believed Rohan was free of Orcs, but they were not entirely driven from the White Mountains until {{TA|2864}} by [[Folca]].\n\nDuring [[Thengel]]'s reign, a mysterious Northerner calling himself [[Thorongil]] entered his service, and rode with him for some time. \n\nAround {{TA|2960|n}}, Saruman began harassing Rohan. In {{TA|3014|n}}, he began using his influence to weaken King [[Théoden]], and in {{TA|3019|n}}, he launched a full-scale invasion. Théoden's son, [[Théodred]] was killed during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], and during the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen|Second]], Saruman's forces crossed the Isen and scattered the Rohirric forces. Some regrouped with Théoden at the [[Hornburg]], where they were besieged. With help from the [[Huorns]], Saruman's forces were defeated at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. \n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Pursuit in Rohan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Pursuit in Rohan'']]\nOn the heels of this victory, Théoden rode with an army to [[Minas Tirith]] and helped break its siege in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where he was slain. [[Éomer]], his nephew, succeeded to the throne, beginning the third line. Éomer rode with the armies of Gondor to the [[Gate of Mordor|gates of Mordor]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Morannon|final battle]] with the forces of [[Sauron]], who was defeated when the [[The One Ring|Ruling Ring]] was destroyed.\n\nThe rule of the Stewards of Gondor was now over. King Éomer and the new king of Gondor, [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], renewed their oath of alliance, and reaffirmed Cirion's grant of Calenardhon to the Rohirrim. Though Sauron had perished, Éomer often fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]] and went with [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] far into the East and South. He was known as Éomer Éadig, or \"the Blessed\", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again.\n\nAfter the downfall of Sauron, [[Gimli]] led a party of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to Aglarond, the [[Glittering Caves]] of the [[White Mountains]] within the realm of Rohan, to which there was an entrance in [[Helm's Deep]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n==Politics== \n===Military===\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|Rohirrim from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]\nThe military of the [[Rohirrim]] was commanded by Marshals. The [[First Marshal of the Riddermark]] was the highest military rank and commanded the [[Muster of Edoras]]: riders of the capital [[Edoras]] and the surrounding lands, including the [[King's Lands]] and [[Harrowdale]]. In his youth, King [[Théoden]] had led the Riders of the Muster of Edoras himself, so that no First Marshal was needed and at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], there was no First Marshal. \n\nThe Second and Third Marshals had no fixed duties, and their roles changed according to the needs of the time. The [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark]] and was based in Helm's Deep and around the War of the Ring it was filled by Théoden's son, Prince Théodred, and later [[Erkenbrand]] after the death of the prince. The [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark]] was based at [[Aldburg]] in the [[Folde]] and around the War of the Ring it was filled by [[Éomer]].\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, the new rank of [[Marshal of the East-mark]] was created for eastern Rohan by King Éomer. The first Rider to hold it was his lieutenant, [[Elfhelm]].\n\nThe Riders were divided into one hundred [[Éored]]s. in the days of King [[Folcwine]], a \"full Éored\" was defined as 120 horsemen (including its captain).<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 36</ref> This would imply that a full muster of the Riders of the Rohirrim would number at least twelve thousand, if not many more. This does not include levied infantry, such as those [[Erkenbrand]] led at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref name=\"TT|Deep\">{{TT|Deep}}</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Gondor===\nThe alliance between Rohan and [[Gondor]] came into existence in the year {{TA|2510|n}} of the [[Third Age]]. In that year, the Easterlings launched a massive invasion of Gondor. The army of Gondor was defeated and trapped between the [[Limlight]] and the [[Celebrant]]. Gondor, which had always been on friendly terms with the different tribes of the [[Northmen]], sent messengers to the closest tribe, the [[Éothéod]]. Although it was unlikely that the message calling for aid would come through, it did. Then [[Eorl the Young]] and his fierce Éothéod Riders unexpectedly took the field during the Battle of Celebrant and turned the tide in the favour of Gondor. As a reward, [[Cirion]], the [[Steward of Gondor]], gave Eorl the depopulated province of [[Calenardhon]] for his people to settle, while fulfilling Gondor's need for a strong ally. The [[Oath of Eorl]] was sworn by both Cirion and Eorl. Neither nation broke the alliance. Rohan went to great lengths to fulfil their part of the treaty including sacrificing two of its heirs when Gondor was under threat from the [[Haradrim]] in [[Third Age 2885|T.A. 2885]], when [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]], the twin sons of King [[Folcwine]], were killed during the Battle of Crossings of [[Poros]]. King [[Théoden]] once again honoured the alliance in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In the years after his rise to the throne, King [[Éomer]] would often assist [[King Elessar]] of Gondor in his wars against the foes of Gondor.<ref>{{App|A2i}}</ref>\n\n===War with the Dunlendings===\nTo the west of Rohan lived the [[Dunlendings]], a native people who had been hostile against the [[Free peoples]] for a long time. The Dunlending [[Wulf]] (whose father [[Freca]] was killed by King [[Helm]]) invaded Rohan and usurped the throne. Pressed by the west and east, the Rohirrim took refuge in the [[White Mountains]]. The [[Long Winter]] came upon the combatants, which caused many losses from both sides. Prince [[Háma (son of Helm)|Háma]] was lost in a blizzard searching for food while Prince [[Haleth]] was slain on the doors of the [[Golden Hall]]. Helm had also died from the freezing temperatures in {{TA|2759}}. Wulf was soon defeated by [[Fréaláf]], who was [[Helm Hammerhand]]'s nephew and became the tenth King of Rohan.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> \n\nRohan recovered very slowly from the war and the Winter and [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] welcomed [[Saruman]] and allowed him to dwell in [[Isengard]] in {{TA|2759}} hoping that he would help the Rohirrim. The following years, after {{TA|2799|n}}, the [[Orcs]] who were defeated and fled from the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] attempted to establish themselves in the White Mountains. As they crossed Rohan, they infested the dales and many years of fighting passed until they were eradicated.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Saruman incited the Dunlendings against the Rohirrim and they fought alongside the [[Uruk-hai]] in the Battle of the Hornburg.<ref name=\"TT|Deep\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Rohan'' (coined by [[Hallas]]) is [[Gondor Sindarin]], meaning \"Horse-country\". ''Rohan'' is a debased form of the proper [[Sindarin]] name ''Rochand'' (or ''Rochan''), containing the elements ''[[Horses#Etymology|roch]]'' (\"[[Horses|horse]]\") and the toponymical ending ''[[-nd|-and]]''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Nancy Smith]], \"\"[[Index questions]]\"</ref><ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Cirion}}, \"iii. Cirion and Eorl\"</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 247-8</ref>\n\nThe native name of the country was '''[[Riddermark]]''', or simply '''the Mark,''' a term used by the Rohirrim to describe their homeland. ''Riddermark'' means \"land of the knights\", derived from the [[Old English]] compound ''Riddena-mearc,'' with ''ridda'' referring to a \"knight of the king's trained cavalry\" and the term ''mark'' meaning a borderland, serving as a defence of the inner lands of a realm.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', citing from the entry Riddermakr in J.R.R.

Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', \"[[Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan]]\", \"(iii) Cirion and Eorl\", p. 306</ref>\n\nIn a draft of ''The Appendices'', Tolkien noted that ''Rohan'' \"is of [[Noldorin]] origin, a translation of the native ''[[Lōgrad]]''\", having the \"strictly correct form [...] ''Rochann''.\"<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 53</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nConceptualized as the \"Horse kings of Rohan\" who allied with [[Mordor]] in early drafts of [[1939]], the [[Rohirrim]] took their final form in [[1942]] when the text of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was about one-third completed.\n\n==Inspiration==\nSeveral aspects of Rohan's culture and history seem to be inspired by both Goths, Scandinavians and the medieval Anglo-Saxons. Just like the Germanic Ostrogoths, Rohirric culture was a mounted culture. It had separated from the [[Northmen]], moved south, and had settled in close proximity with a civilization. In the Goths' case it was the eastern part of the Roman Empire and in the case of the [[Rohirrim]], it was [[Gondor]].\n\nThe granting of the province of Calenardhon by Gondor to the Rohirrim resembles the grant of land to the Ostrogoths by the Roman Empire to protect it against invaders.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 697</ref> \n\nEspecially the Hervarar saga, with its Mirkwood, Gothic horsemen and shield maidens, appears to have inspired Tolkien when creating the Rohirrim, although he exchanged the Gothic tongue with the Anglo-Saxon. The antipathy between the Rohirrim and the Dunlendings resembles the historical tension between the Anglo-Saxon settlers of Britain and the native Celts.\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] might have been inspired by [[William Morris]]'s use of 'Mid-mark' in ''[[The House of the Wolfings]]'', a book which Tolkien owned and from which he took inspiration. Furthermore, the name of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, which included Tolkien's hometown of [[Birmingham]] and his alma mater [[Oxford]], is a Latinism used by historians, as the native term was not recorded.  The West Saxons called their neighbors in Mercia the ''Mierce'', a derivation by i-mutation from ''Mearc'', which would certainly have been pronounced ''Mark.''  <ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Reader's Guide'', \"Morris, William\", p. 600</ref><ref>[[Tom Shippey]], [[The Road to Middle-earth]], chapter 4 A Cartographic Plot, The horses of the Mark, second edition 1992, p. 111</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Rohan map with towns marked.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Rohan towns in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Rohan is split into two major halves, divided by the river [[Entwash]]. Eastern Rohan, including the [[Eastemnet]], the [[East Wall of Rohan|East Wall]], and [[Nen Hithoel]], was added in [[2012]] with the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'' expansion. A smaller update added the region \"Wildermore\" to the north of the Eastemnet, between the [[The Wold|Wold]] and [[Fangorn Forest]]. Western Rohan, including the [[Westemnet]], [[Eastfold]], [[Westfold]], and [[Helm's Deep]], was added in [[2013]] with ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep expansion]]''.\n\n:In addition to those mentioned in Tolkien's works, in-game Rohan features many other landmarks and settlements. [[The Mark]] is further divided into \"Ridings\", each governed by a Reeve from the chief town, with the surrounding villages each led by a Thane. The Reeves answer to either [[Aldor]] [[Harding (rider of Rohan)|Harding]] of the Eastemnet or to King [[Théoden]] directly. At the center of each settlement is a grand mead hall, which serves as the seat of the local Thane or Reeve, the place for communal gatherings and the most defensible position in case of an attack.\n\n:Outside the borders of Rohan proper, the large fortified town of \"Stangard\" on the northern shore of the river [[Limlight]] guards the approaches from the [[Brown Lands]]. During the [[War of the Ring]] almost all of Rohan's settlements come under attack by the enemy, with several towns completely razed and burned to the ground, while some smaller villages are completely abandoned when the inhabitants flee to nearby cities for protection.\n\n{{references}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Rohan|Rohan]]\n[[de:Rohan]]\n[[fi:Rohan]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/royaumes/rohan]]",

It was the original seat of the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King of Arnor]] who ruled over both Arnor and [[Gondor]].\n\n==Geography==\nArnor included most of [[Eriador]], extending from the gulf of [[Lune]] (west of which was [[Lindon]]) to the river [[Greyflood]] and its tributary, the river [[Loudwater]] (east of which was [[Rivendell]]).<ref name=\"eriador\" />\n\nThe Dúnedain of Arnor dwelt in many places in Eriador, but most of the population centered around the region of [[Arthedain]].  The Dunedain mainly inhabited the cities of [[Fornost]] and the capital city of [[Annúminas]], as well as along the [[Baranduin]] and the gulf of [[Lune]].  By the later [[Third Age]], the settlements of the Dúnedain of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] had decayed and become ruins and [[barrows]].<ref name=\"rings\" />\n===Regions===\n\n*[[Arthedain]], the core of the north-kingdom bordering the Lune\n*[[Cardolan]], the lands south of the [[East Road]], east of the Brandywine\n*[[Rhudaur]], the region between the Weather Hills and the [[Misty Mountains]]\n\n===Sites of civilization===\n\n*[[Annúminas]], the old capital on the shore of Lake Evendim\n*[[Fornost]], the new capital of the successor state of Arthedain\n*[[Bree]], a trading centre located on the East Road\n*[[Lond Daer]], an old harbour town founded by Númenóreans\n*[[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]], also called Weathertop, a watchtower on the highest of the Weather Hills\n*[[Elostirion]], an elven watchtower in the [[Tower Hills]]\n*[[Tharbad]], a fortified town and port on each side of the River Greyflood on the southern border of Arnor\n\n===''[[Palantíri]]''===\n\nThe '''[[Palantíri]]''' or 'seeing stones' were spherical stones that could communicate with each other and give visual impressions to a skilled remote user.  [[Elendil]] and his two sons originally divided these stones between themselves.  They were usually heavily guarded and under the control of the kings.  There were seven of these stones in total.  The northern kingdom possessed three, and the southern kingdom held the other four.<ref name=\"rings\" />{{rp|362}} They were:\n\n*The [[Elostirion-stone]], kept in the tower of [[Elostirion]]. This was used to communicate with The Master Stone in [[Tol Eressëa]], the Lonely Isle of the Elves, along the [[Straight Road]].  It could not contact the other Middle-Earth stones.\n*The [[Amon Sûl-stone]], kept in the watchtower of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]].  The [[Amon Sûl-stone]] was a large stone, and the northern kings often used it to contact its corresponding large stone in Gondor, at the great dome of [[Osgiliath]].\n*The [[Annúminas-stone]], kept in Arnor's capital city of [[Annúminas]].  Though one of the lesser stones, it was the stone most often used by the [[Kings of Arnor]].\n\n==History==\n<!--\"Events\" in Eriador infobox links here-->\n===Early history===\nBefore the foundation of Arnor, [[Eriador]] was home to [[Middle Men]] of [[Edain]] stock. As a result of the slow emigration that started under the [[Númenórean]]  kings [[Tar-Meneldur]] and [[Tar-Aldarion]], a sizable population formed. These early colonists soon interbred with the indigenous population of Eriador.  The [[Faithful]] favored Eriador over the more southern regions (Gondor) because the [[Elves of Lindon]] under their high king [[Gil-galad]] lived very near across the river [[Lhûn]].<ref name=\"rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref>{{rp|360}} Conversely, the [[King's Men]] settled more to the south in the later days. Thus, the area was populated by people who were mainly still Faithful and [[Elf-friends]], where much of the knowledge of the [[Elder Days]] was preserved.\n\n[[File:Steven White Jr. -  Ann18.jpg|left|220px|thumb|''Palace Complex at Annúminas'' by Steven White, Jr.]]\nDuring the [[Downfall of Númenor]], [[Elendil]] and his people sailed through the [[Gulf of Lune]] and up the [[Lune]] river, and befriended the [[High King of the Noldor]] Gil-galad.<ref name=\"rings\" /> Both Elendil and his sons were welcomed by the Men who were in whole or part of [[Númenorean]] blood.<ref name=\"rings\" /><ref name=\"languages\">{{App|Men}}</ref> These [[Men of Eriador]] accepted the new kingdom of Elendil and helped to people and maintain the many places that the Northern Dúnedain built.<ref name=\"rings\" /> The [[Men of Bree]] also became subjects of Arnor.<ref name=\"languages\" /> Gil-galad and [[Elves of Lindon|his people]] aided the fledgling realm; he even built the [[Emyn Beraid]] for Elendil.<ref name=\"rings\" /> \n\nElendil founded Arnor at the end of the [[Second Age]] ({{SA|3320}}), while his sons founded the southern realm of [[Gondor]]. Both kingdoms of the [[Númenóreans]] were known as the [[Realms in Exile]], and their history is intertwined. \nDespite its precedence over it as the seat of the High King, Arnor was never as powerful and populous as Gondor.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>\n\nElendil established the city of [[Annúminas]] as his capital. Besides the chief cities like Annúminas and [[Fornost]], the [[Men of Arnor]] concentrated around the courses of the Lhûn and the [[Baranduin]], the  hills of [[Rhudaur]], and built towers on [[Amon Sûl]].<ref name=\"rings\" /> \n\n===[[War of the Last Alliance]]===\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Isildur 2.jpg|right|thumb|''Isildur'' in Peter Jackson's ''The Fellowship of the Ring'']]\nIn {{SA|3430}}, Arnor joined forces with [[Gil-galad]] in a great alliance opposing Sauron, the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. When Elendil led his people against [[Sauron]], the [[Dúnedain]] and the other Men of Eriador marched together to the South.<ref name=\"rings\" /> In conjunction with southern forces from Gondor, they confronted Sauron's armies in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. This great war lasted several years, reaching [[Dagorlad]] and [[Mordor]] itself far in the south, culminating in the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]].  Both [[Elendil]] and his son [[Anárion]] were slain in this conflict, but [[Isildur]] cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's finger and prevailed. \n\nIsildur (who was also King of Gondor) was the elder son of Elendil and would inherit the High Kingship and throne of Arnor. But he never reached his new realm: he was killed in {{TA|2}} in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], as were his three eldest sons; the [[One Ring]] was also lost there. \n\nIsildur's fourth and youngest son, [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], who had remained at [[Rivendell]] due to his youth, became [[Heir of Isildur|his heir]] ({{TA|10}}). But the Men of Arnor suffered heavy casualties in the War and subsequent Disaster; there now remained too few people and the places that Elendil had built became partially depopulated. Arnor never fully recovered from the devastating losses.<ref name=\"rings\" />\n\nBecause neither Valandil nor his subsequent heirs claimed the throne of Gondor (at least until [[Arvedui|Arvedui's]] attempt), the realms were split; but whilst Arnor's ruler kept the title [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]], in practice they were Kings of Arnor only, and had no power over the South kingdom.  [[Anárion]] and his heirs made no claim over the Northern kingdom and styled themselves as simply as [[Kings of Gondor]].\n\n===Breakup, decline, and war with Angmar===\nArnor's capital was [[Annúminas]] on [[Lake Evendim]], but by {{TA|861}} [[Fornost Erain]] had taken its place. No longer a site of such importance, Annúminas became depopulated and was slowly abandoned.\n\nAfter the death of its tenth king, [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]], in {{TA|861}}, Arnor was divided up between his three sons. The eldest, [[Amlaith]], claimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the region of Arthedain as his kingdom, while the other sons founded the kingdoms of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]].<ref name=\"eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref name=\"rings\" /><ref name=\"ta\">{{App|TA}}</ref> The three petty kingdoms often strove with each other, usually over control of the [[Weather Hills]] and the [[palantíri|palantír]] of [[Amon Sûl]].<ref name=\"eriador\" /> \n\n[[File:Grant Gould - The Witch King.jpg|right|thumb|220px|''The Witch King'' by Eliot Gould]]\n\nSeeing the disunion in Arnor, during the reign of Malvegil (c. {{TA|1300}}), the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] arose in the north, later identified as in fact the lord of [[Sauron]]'s [[Ringwraiths]]. This new threat began attacking Rhudaur and Cardolan.<ref name=\"eriador\" />  \n\nEventually the line of [[Isildur]] failed in Arthedain's sister kingdoms; the Dúnedain were always few in Rhudaur, where a lord of the [[Hill-men]], secretly supporting Angmar, seized power. Arnor was refounded ''de jure'' by the seventh [[King of Arthedain]], [[Argeleb I]], and Cardolan placed itself under its suzerainty, but Rhudaur resisted. Arthedain thus reasserted control over Cardolan and fortified a line along the [[Weather Hills]], but Rhudaur and Angmar attacked and killed the King in {{TA|1356}}. His son [[Arveleg I]], however, counterattacked in conjunction with Cardolan and [[Lindon]] and drove the enemy back.<ref name=\"eriador\" />\n[[File:BFME2 - Weathertop.jpg|left|220px|thumb|''Weathertop'' from BFME2]]\nArveleg continued to hold the frontier along the Hills for the following years, until {{TA|1409}}, when Angmar crossed the [[Hoarwell]] and successfully captured [[Weathertop]], and Arveleg fell in battle, as did the [[last prince of Cardolan]] (later interred in the [[Barrow-downs]]).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"Fog on the Barrow-downs\", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref> Amon Sûl fell, and its ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír]]'' was taken to Fornost.  With Amon Sûl lost, Angmar had free rein over the all the lands of Cardolan, which was ravaged, and the population was forced to hold out in the Barrow Downs, or took refuge in the [[Old Forest]]. Rhudaur was occupied by evil Men subject to [[Angmar]], and the remaining Dúnedain were slain or fled west.<ref name=\"eriador\" /> \n\n[[The Shire]], once the hunting grounds of the [[King of Arnor]], was a fertile and well-tilled part of Arnor, deserted during the waning days of Arthedain. The [[Hobbits]] (who had lived in [[Dunland]] and parts of depopulated [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]) got official permission from King [[Argeleb II]] to settle the lands. This was finally done in {{TA|1601}} by [[Bree-hobbits]] led by the brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]]; almost all of the Hobbits of Middle-earth could be found there 30 years later. The [[Shire-hobbits]] considered themselves subjects of the King of Arthedain: at least nominally, considering the isolation of their country. Nevertheless, their histories claim they sent some support troops to the great battles Arnor fought against Angmar.<ref name=\"eriador\" />\n\nThe Men of Arnor did not have the strength to drive away the forces of Angmar, so the [[Elves of Lindon]], forces of [[Rivendell]], and the [[Galadhrim]] would defeat the armies of Angmar much later.<ref name=\"eriador\" />\n\n===The [[Great Plague]]===\n[[File:Amir Salehi - Servant of Death.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Amir Salehi - ''Servant of Death'']]\nAnother threat to the northern kingdoms appeared, the [[Great Plague]] that came from the [[East]]. The Men of Arnor were so much affected that the joint garrison at [[Tharbad]] that Arnor held with Gondor ceased to exist,<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> and the last of the Dúnedain of Cardolan died on the Barrow-downs. The Witch-king, exploiting the tragedy, sent evil spirits, the [[Barrow-wights]], to infest the area.\n\nThe [[Shire-folk]] were damaged by it, but not heavily. The plague lost its strength at this point however, so that most of [[Arthedain]] was unaffected.<ref name=\"eriador\" />  \n\nThe two Realms in Exile eventually suspected that these disasters might be being coordinated by a single power, and resumed communications. As a result, Prince Arvedui, heir to the Sceptre, wedded [[Fíriel]], the daughter of [[Ondoher]] [[King of Gondor]] ({{TA|1940}}). That happened before Ondoher was slain in battle, and hoping to save his Kingdom, Arvedui staked his claim to Gondor, by right of his descent from Elendil and by that of his wife. The [[Council of Gondor]] refused the reunification and crowned King [[Eärnil II]], who maintained good relations with Arnor, promising aid against Angmar. But Arnor's strength was fast dwindling; in {{TA|1973}} Arvedui (who now was King) sent a message to Gondor that Angmar was preparing its final assault, and Eärnil mustered a great armament bound for [[Lindon]], but it would arrive too late.<ref name=\"gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\n===Fall of Arthedain===\n\nIn {{TA|1974}}, the final chapter in Arthedain's history began. The Witch-king attacked during the harsh winter weather. The capital of [[Fornost]] fell, and the remaining Arnorian forces were driven over the Lune river into Lindon.<ref name=\"eriador\" /> Arvedui fled to [[Forochel]], while his son, [[Aranarth]], informed [[Círdan]] at the [[Grey Havens]] about the disaster. Círdan's sailors were eventually unable to rescue Arvedui, and [[Malbeth]] the Seer's prophecy at his birth, that he would be the 'Last king' of Arthedain, was fulfilled. \n\n===Showdown with Angmar===\nThe Gondorian naval forces under [[Eärnur]], [[Captain of Gondor]] eventually landed in the Grey Havens, from which debarked the most powerful army seen in the north of Middle-earth in centuries. \n\nThe remnants of Arnor would later join the great force, led by Cirdan and Eärnur, in the greatest joint Elf-Man army since the [[War of the Last Alliance]]; this great [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]] marched northward toward the Arnorian capital of Fornost, where the Witch-king had occupied.\nHe confidently marched his forces out to meet them in the open. The Host attacked him from the [[Hills of Evendim]], and a [[Battle of Fornost|large battle]] broke out. The cavalry under Eärnur pursued what remained of the Angmar forces, and were joined by an Elven force under [[Glorfindel]] from [[Rivendell]]. Angmar fell but the Witch-King fled.\n\nThus both Arthedain and Angmar were destroyed. the Dúnedain of Arnor created new homes in the [[Angle of Eriador|Angle]] south of [[Rivendell]], but Aranarth perceived that his people had become too few after the continuing wars to reestablish the realm. [[Men of Bree|Some Men]] survived in [[Bree]] and other villages, while the Hobbits survived in the Shire and Bree; in the Shire they chose a [[Thain]] from among themselves to replace the fallen King in {{TA|1979}}. The Shire remained a minor but independent political unit.<ref name=\"lotr1018\">{{App|Arnor}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===[[Rangers of the North]]===\nAranarth, instead of calling himself a king or prince, assumed the title [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]] and led his dwindling people, now secretive wanderers who traveled from place to place in Eriador. His son, [[Arahael]], grew up safely in Rivendell under the fosterhood of [[Elrond]], a tradition that was followed through the rest of the Third Age. Also brought to Elrond were the heirlooms of the [[House of Isildur]]: the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]], the [[Ring of Barahir]], the shards of [[Narsil]], and the [[Star of Elendil]].<ref name=\"eriador\" /> Thus, through them the royal [[House of Isildur]] was maintained successfully from father to son for a millennium.\n\nThere were sixteen Chieftains in direct descent, under many perils in Eriador, and many of the Chieftains died premature deaths. One of these was [[Arathorn II]], who was slain by Orcs raiding the area. So the Dúnedain survived in the shadows, waiting for a better day when the kingdom would be reborn, which would come in the time of [[Aragorn]], on [[1 May]], {{TA|3019}}. \n\n===[[War of the Ring]]===\nThe Kingdom of Arnor had been fallen for a thousand years by the time the [[War of the Ring]] broke out, but northern forces did participate in the War. [[Aragorn]] participated, the [[Heir of Isildur]], and there were several hundred of them operating during the conflict. The  A company of this group accompanied Aragorn through the [[Paths of the Dead]] and during the attack on [[Umbar]] which captured the Corsair fleet.  They participated at the last battle, fighting under his banner, at the [[Battle of the Morannon]], where [[Sauron]] was finally thrown down.\n\nThere was conflict in other areas of the North.  There were three different invasions of [[Lothlórien]], which were thrown back by the Elven army under [[Celeborn]] and [[Thranduil]].  Finally, Celeborn led an attack resulting in the [[Fall of Dol Guldur|capture of Dol Guldur]] and put an end to Sauron's northern threat.\n\nThere was also a battle fought in [[the Shire]], between Saruman's [[Ruffians]] and [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] militia forces.  This was the last battle fought in the [[War of the Ring]], and resulted in the death of Saruman and the death or capture of his followers.  This became known as the [[Battle of Bywater]], and represents the Hobbit contribution to the War.<ref name=\"lotr992-996\">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[The Scouring of the Shire]], pp. 992-6</ref>\n\n===Restoration and the [[Reunited Kingdom]]===\n[[File:Rowena Morrill - The Last Steward of Gondor.jpg|left|220px|thumb|''The Last Steward of Gondor'' by Rowena Morrill]]\nFaramir, son of Denethor II the last Ruling Steward, presented his rod of office to the new king, and received it back from him.  [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] then was crowned by [[Gandalf]] as [[Aragorn|King Elessar]], refounded the Kingdom of Arnor as part of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], and made [[Annúminas]] his new capital city.<ref name=\"lotr1019\">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]], p. 1019.</ref> He was wed to the Elven princess Arwen, who became [[Arwen|Queen Evenstar]] of Arnor and Gondor.  After the fall of [[Sauron]] Arnor was safe again for resettlement of Men, and although it remained less populated than [[Gondor]] to the south, in time Arnor became a more densely populated region again, even if it had dwindled in size due to the independence of [[the Shire]].  The area encompassed by the Reunited Kingdom now included the territory of the [[Two Kingdoms]] at their greatest extent.  In the North, this included all the land between the [[Lune|River Lune]] and the [[Misty Mountains]], and in the South included all the land between Dunland in the west, to the [[Far Harad]] southwards, to [[Rhûn]] in the east. The reborn kingdom continued on into the Fourth Age, with [[Eldarion]] eventually succeeding his father to the throne of this now empire-sized state.\n\n==Languages==\nMany people in Arnor were of Númenórean stock. However, aside from the Exiles, most had long since mingled with non-Númenórean peoples; the predominant language spoken by them was [[Westron]].<ref>{{App|F}}</ref> At least some of the population, especially the upper classes, were fluent in [[Sindarin]], while [[Quenya]] was studied as a language of lore. Many early place names and the names of the [[House of Isildur|royal house]] were Quenya, but by the 8th century of the [[Third Age]], Quenya had given way to Sindarin.\n\n==Etymology==\n'''''Arnor''''' was the colloquial name for the '''North Kingdom'''. The North Kingdom, as the land was called at its conception, was also known as ''Turmen Follondiéva'' in [[Quenya]] and ''Arthor na Forlonnas'' in [[Sindarin]]. These names quickly fell out of use, in favour of ''Arnor'': the ''Land of the King'', so called for the kingship of [[Elendil]], and to seal its precedence over the [[Gondor|southern realm]]. In full, poetic Sindarin, it was called ''Arannor'', which mirrored its Quenya name, '''''Arandórë'''''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 28</ref> Though technically ''Arandórë'' would have a Sindarin form ''Ardor'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] chose ''Arnor'' because it sounded better. This linguistic change was ascribed to a later, Mannish development of Sindarin.<ref name=\"L347\">{{L|347}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 17</ref> The form '''''Arnanórë''''' is also seen.<ref name=\"L347\" />\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe subdivision of the Númenórean realms in exile into a northwestern kingdom of Arnor and a southeastern kingdom of Gondor resembles the subdivision of the Roman Empire into a Western Roman Empire and an Eastern Roman Empire (the Byzantine Empire). Emperor Charlemagne established a kind of successor empire to the Western Roman Empire, which (partially) survived as the Holy Roman Empire until A.D. 1806.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 689</ref>\n\nThe breaking up of Arnor into the three successor kingsdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] resembles the breaking up of the Carolingian Empire, a successor of parts of the Western Roman Empire, after the death of King Louis the Pious, the son of Charlemagne, into three kingdoms that were ruled by three of his sons.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 690</ref>\n\nIn a letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, the authors of a draft of an article who had interviewed him, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] stated that the tale \"ends in what is far more like the re-establishment of an effective Holy Roman Empire with its seat in Rome\".<ref>{{L|294}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2002: {{tttee}}:\n:Peter Jackson's movies do not mention the long history of how Arnor and Gondor diverged, nor do they mention Arnor by name. The one passing reference to it is in a scene from the Extended Edition, when Aragorn reveals to Éowyn that he is actually eighty-seven years old. She realises that he must be one of the [[Dúnedain]], a descendant of Númenor blessed with long life, but says that she thought his race had passed into legend. Aragorn acknowledges that he is one of the Dúnedain, and explains that there are not many of his people left, because \"the Northern kingdom was destroyed long ago\".\n\n'''2012: [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]:'''\n:The kingdom of Arnor is mentioned indirectly by [[Galadriel]] in the [[White Council]] scene, and so is the [[Angmar War|war with Angmar]] and its aftermath.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kings of Arnor]]\n*[[Kings of Gondor]]\n*[[Gondor]]\n*[[War of the Last Alliance]]\n*[[War of the Ring]]\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Arnor| ]]\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Arnor]]\n[[fi:Arnor]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/royaumes/arnor]]",

In {{YT|1115}}<ref name=\"Annals\">{{AA|60-2}}</ref> the Elves travelled through [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] and reached the river [[Anduin]]. The [[Teleri]] stayed on the eastern side of the river for a long time and were afraid of the [[Misty Mountains]]. The [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] crossed the river and travelled over passes of the Misty Mountains with help from [[Oromë]]. A numerous part of the Teleri under the leadership of [[Lenwë]] abandoned] the march to the west, went [[Sundering of the Elves|away]] south down the river and became known as the [[Nandor]]. The rest of the Teleri continued their march to the west and passed over the Misty Mountains.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>\n\nAfter the awakening of the Elves the ancestors of the [[Longbeards|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]] awoke at [[Mount Gundabad]] at the northern end of the Misty Mountains. They expanded east to the [[Iron Hills]] where they mined for iron-ore and southwards down the [[Vales of Anduin]] where they founded their chief underground city [[Moria]] further south in the Misty Mountains. They also considered the Grey Mountains and the east vales of the Misty Mountains as their territory.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}, pp. 302-303</ref>\n\nAfter they had [[Awakening of Men|awakened]] in [[Hildórien]] in the far east of Middle-earth, some groups of [[Men]] travelled through Rhovanion on their way to the west of Middle-earth until they reached Greenwood the Great and then split into different groups. Some of them passed between the northern edge of Greenwood the Great and the Grey Mountains. Others passed south of the southern edge of Greenwood the Great until they reached the river Anduin and then migrated to the north up the Vales of Anduin. Only a small part of them moved on to Eriador and Beleriand. Most of those Men that remained in the north of Rhovanion were related to the House of Hador and became known as the Northmen. They were skilled riders and mostly lived in scattered farms, villages and small townships, which were fortified by wooden fences and dikes at best. The Longbeard Dwarves soon started to trade tools, weapons, arms and other items that required a lot of skill or were costly was well and their services as builders, miners and roadmakers in exchange for food produced by Men as farmers and herdsmen.<ref name=relations/>\n\nThe [[Orcs]] stopped harassing the region when most were concentrated to the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]] in [[Beleriand]], and Rhovanion existed in relative peace;<ref name=relations/> it was not otherwise mentioned until the [[Second Age]].\n\n=== Second Age ===\nAfter the destruction of [[Angband]] in the [[War of Wrath]], large well-armed hordes of Orcs fled to the east in search of new homes and attacked the Longbeard Dwarves. Initially the Men of Rhovanion were only lightly armed, primarily with bows, because they had little metal and only had few unskilled smiths. Early in the Second Age, the Longbeard Dwarves who were outnumbered by the Orcs formed an alliance with the Men of Rhovanion and provided them with arms and armour made from metal in exchange for the aid in the fight against the Orcs. The Men of Rhovanion acted as mounted scouts that kept watch for the movements of Orcs. Whenever they discovered groups of Orcs they gathered a large troop of mounted archers, surrounded them and destroyed them.<ref name=relations/> For many lives of Men the territory of the Longbeards included the east side of the Misty Mountains to the edge of [[Lothlórien]], the Grey Mountains, the [[Lonely Mountain]] and the Iron Hills. Then Men of Rhovanion lived adjacent to them all the way to the south to the [[Old Forest Road]] that led through Greenwood the Great to the Iron Hills.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 30</ref>\n\nRhovanion played host to two [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] Elf kingdoms ruled by [[Sindar]]in lords: Northern Greenwood and Lórinand (or [[Lothlórien|Lórien]]).\n\nThe great battlefield (or [[Dagorlad]]) of the [[War of the Last Alliance]] against the host of [[Sauron]] lay in the south of Rhovanion, and in the [[Gladden Fields]] of the Great River the High King of Gondor and [[Arnor]], [[Isildur]], son of [[Elendil]], was killed.\n\n=== Third Age ===\nSometime around {{TA|1050}}, due to the darkness around [[Dol Guldur]], the [[Harfoots]] left the [[Vales of Anduin]] westwards, beginning the [[Wandering Days]]. The [[Fallohides]] would follow, but the [[Stoors]] remained until {{TA|1150}}. Some Stoors would continue to dwell in the vales of the Anduin until at least the late Third Age.\n\nIn the mid-13th century there were many northern princes, the most prominent of them being [[Vidugavia]], who ruled between [[Mirkwood]] and the [[River Running]], although he called himself \"[[King of Rhovanion]]\"<ref name=\"AppGondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> About this time [[Regent]] [[Minalcar]] of [[Gondor]] led a great expedition into Rhovanion in {{TA|1248}} and utterly defeated the [[Easterlings]], with substantial help from the [[Northmen]] and from Vidugavia in particular. Vidugavia became Gondor's strong ally.<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n\nIn {{TA|1248}}, [[Rómendacil II]], who as Minalcar served as Regent to his uncle of [[Atanatar II]] of Gondor, destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]], and a strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged. The King of Rhovanion at this time was [[Vidugavia]] - ruling the lands between [[Mirkwood]] and the [[River Running]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/> - and Prince [[Valacar]] of Gondor served in his army and integrated with their culture. Vidugavia's daughter [[Vidumavi]] married Valacar, and their son Vinitharya became King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] in {{TA|1432|n}}, which led to the [[Kin-strife]] in {{TA|1437|n}}. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion, and with a Rhovanion army, he reclaimed his Kingdom in {{TA|1447|n}}.\n\nIn {{TA|1636}}, the [[Great Plague]] devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half its people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in {{TA|1851|n}} the [[Wainriders]] overran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but in {{TA|1899|n}} Rhovanion revolted, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from the west. Rhovanion was freed but left extremely weakened. Many Men of Rhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant relatives.\n\nIn {{TA|1851}}, the [[Battle of the Plains]] was fought by Gondor and the Northmen against the Wainriders; [[Narmacil II|King Narmacil II]] of Gondor and the Northman [[Marhari]] (a descendant of Vidugavia)<ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Northmen}}</ref> were both killed in this battle.<ref group=note>The [[Lord of the Eotheod|Lords of the Eotheod]] claimed descent from the '...kings of Rhovanion, whose realm lay beyond Mirkwood before the invasions of the Wainriders...' according to Appendix A to ''''The Lord of the Rings''''.</ref> Refugees from this defeat were reorganized as the [[Éothéod]] on the other side of Mirkwood in the lower [[Vales of Anduin]], under the leadership of [[Marhwini]], son of Marhari.<ref name=\"Cirion\"/> Many of the Northmen remained in their old lands as a subject people of the Wainriders. Others fled north, with some mingling with the [[Men of Dale|people of Dale]].<ref name=\"Cirion\"/>\n\n====Later history====\nIn the later Third Age, in the north lay the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] kingdoms of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the Dwarf halls in the Ered Mithrin, the kingdom of [[Dale]], and in the north of the great river [[Anduin]] lay the realm of the [[Éothéod]]. In the north of Greenwood lived the Silvan Elves ruled by [[Thranduil]], and in the south of Greenwood and across the river in Lórinand ruled [[Amdír]] and later [[Amroth]]. In the far south, near the great falls of [[Sarn Gebir]], watched the northern guard of [[Gondor]], and in the valleys of the Anduin lived Stoors.\n\nIn around {{TA|2460}}, [[Sauron]] returned as the Necromancer he took residence at [[Dol Guldur]] in the south of Greenwood. And Greenwood became evil and was renamed Mirkwood. The Dwarves of Erebor and the Men of Dale were destroyed and scattered when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] took Erebor, and Gondor retreated from the Falls. Some Men still lived along the forest, notably the [[Beornings]] and the Men of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] upon the [[Long Lake]]. The Men of Éothéod removed south at the invite of Gondor and settled the plains of [[Calenardhon]], later [[Rohan]]. After being driven out of Erebor the Dwarves relocated, some went to the Iron Hills, but most went to the [[Ered Luin]] in [[Eriador]].\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, the Kingdoms of Erebor and Dale were restored as a result of the death of Smaug and the [[Battle of Five Armies]], and Sauron was removed from Mirkwood by the wizard [[Gandalf]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], it held off an invasion by Sauron's forces, and after Sauron was defeated Mirkwood was clean again, and renamed ''Eryn Lasgalen'', or \"Wood of Greenleaves\". Some time during the [[Fourth Age]], the [[Reunited Kingdom]] claimed large parts of it.<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Rhovanion'' (more correctly ''Rhovennian''<ref name=Rhoven>{{PE|23b}}, p. 136</ref>) is [[Sindarin]] for \"Wilderland\", consisting of ''[[rhovan]]'' (\"wild\")<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 78, entry \"Rhovanion\"</ref> and the ending for names of regions ''[[-ion]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 42, entry \"Eregion\"; and p. 37, entry \"Azanul-bizar\"</ref>\n\nMore specifically, the Sindarin term ''rhovan'' referred to large beasts, especially the great red [[deer]] who lived in the Vales of Anduin and western Mirkwood.<ref name=Rhoven/>\n\n''Wilderland'' is the translation of ''Rhovanion'' into the [[Common Speech]],<ref name=PE17/> which was also used by [[Hobbits]].<ref name=UI/> [[J.R.R.

It is claimed in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] that the arrangement that Men and Hobbits each minded their own affairs in their own ways, but regarding each other as necessary parts of the population and being on friendly terms existed only in Bree-land.<ref name=\"Sign\" />\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Plan of Bree.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|\"Plan of Bree\" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nThe village was built under and on the western slopes of [[Bree-hill]]. It was surrounded by a deep ditch with a thick hedge on its inner side that ran in more than half of a circle from the hill and back to it. The great East Road entered the village through the West-gate of the hedge on the western side of the village, curved to the right to run around the foot of the hill, exited the village in its southern corner<ref name=\"Sign\" /> through the South-gate of the hedge and then curved to the left back to its easward line.<ref name=\"FR|Knife\">{{FR|Knife}}, p. 181</ref> Both gates<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}, p. 989</ref> were closed and guarded by gatekeepers after nightfall who had small lodges on the inside of the gates.<ref name=\"Sign\" /> During the [[War of the Ring]] the [[West-gate of Bree]] was guarded by [[Harry Goatleaf]].<ref name=\"Homeward\" />\n\nThe village consisted of about a hundred stone houses, most of them on the slope of the hill above the road with windows on their western side, in which the Men lived. The hill itself was burrowed by [[Hobbit-holes]], in which the Hobbits  lived<ref name=\"FR|Sign\">{{FR|Sign}}, p. 156</ref> especially on the higher slopes above the houses of the Men. An inn called [[The Prancing Pony]] was located on the eastern side of the road where it curved to the south to go around the hill.<ref name=\"Sign\" />\n\n==History==\nAccording to their tales the [[Men of Bree]] had settled in Bree in the [[Elder Days]]. They were [[Pre-Númenóreans]] that had migrated from the valleys of the [[White Mountains]] to the southern valleys of the [[Misty Mountains]] and then north as far as the Barrow Downs.<ref name=\"Men\">{{App|Men}}, p. 1130</ref> Although few of them survived the turmoils of the Elder Days, they continued to settle in Bree when the [[Númenóreans]] returned to Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Sign\" />\n\nIn {{SA|3320}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3320, p. 1084</ref> Bree and the Bree-land became a part of the kingdom of Arnor<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> and the Men of Bree abandoned their old language and adopted [[Westron]] as their native language.<ref name=\"Men\" /> When the Kingdom of Arnor was divided in {{TA|861}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 861, p. 1085</ref> Bree probably became a part of [[Arthedain]], one of the three successor states of Arnor, because Arthedain included the land north of the East Road as far as the [[Weather Hills]]<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1039</ref> and because most of the houses of Bree were north of the East road on the slopes of Bree-hill<ref name=\"Sign\" /> and Staddle, Combe and Archet, the other villages of Bree-land were also located north of the East Road.<ref name=\"FR|Knife\" /> However, the possession of Weathertop and the land westwards towards Bree was a matter of debate between Arthedain and the other successor kingdoms of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]], because Cardolan and Rhudaur desired to have the [[Palantíri|Palantír]] of the Tower of Weathertop as Arthedain already possessed the other two Palantírs of the North.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1040</ref>\n\nAround {{TA|1300}} many [[Hobbits]] migrated westward from eastern Eriador and many settled in Bree.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 1300, p. 1086</ref> In {{TA|1601}} many Hobbits left Bree and went west beyond the river [[Baranduin]] and founded a colony within Arthedain, [[The Shire]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1601, p. 1086</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Fall of Fornost]] and Arnor in {{TA|1945}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1945, p. 1086</ref> the north-south road was only used seldomly and was referred to as the Greenway by the Bree-folk, because it had become overgrown by grass. Bree continued to exist with the unknown protection of the [[Rangers of the North]]. Even at the end of the Third Age Bree remained relatively prosperous. Bree was the most westerly settlement of men from the point of view of the Shire by the time of the War of the Ring and had a sizable Hobbit population. Thanks to its location near a major road crossing, one could encounter travelers including Men, Dwarves and Hobbits in a bustling Bree inn. The Rangers of the North also were known to stop in Bree.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}, p. 150</ref>\n\nOn [[15 March]]<ref>{{App|Durin}}, footnote after \"On a time\", p. 1077</ref> {{TA|2941}} [[Gandalf]] and [[Thorin]] met seemingly by accident at Bree. They were both thinking about the same problem: the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] at the [[Lonely Mountain]]. The meeting led to the undertaking of the [[Quest of Erebor]], which resulted in the death of Smaug and the finding of [[the One Ring]] by [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}, footnote, p. 1077-8</ref>\n\nFrom about {{TA|2953}} on the wizard [[Saruman]] began to have agents in Bree.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2953, p. 1089</ref>\n\nOn [[29 September]] {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 29, p. 1091</ref> [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] arrived in Bree and met [[Aragorn|Strider]] at the largest inn in Bree, The Prancing Pony, owned by [[Barliman Butterbur]].<ref name=\"FR|Sign\" /> After Meriadoc had been attacked by a [[Nazgûl|Ringwraith]] Strider feared an attack by servants of the Ringwraiths and convinced them to spend the night in the parlour of the inn instead of their rooms. [[Nob]], an employee of Barliman, stuffed the beds in their rooms to make it appear as if someone was sleeping in them.<ref>{{FR|Strider}}, pp. 173-4</ref> In the morning of [[30 September]], {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 30, p. 1091</ref> they discovered that the windows to their rooms had been forced open and that their stuffed beds had been slashed and left Bree on the same day.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}, pp. 177-181</ref>\n\nWhen [[Travellers|Frodo and his companions]] returned to Bree on [[28 October]], {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for the year 3019, October 28, p. 1096</ref> Barliman Butterbur told them that Bree had been raided early in the year by [[ruffians]] from the south during the War of the Ring. Barliman Butterbur believed that they had been let into Bree by Harry Goatleaf and Bill Ferny, who had been on the side of the ruffians and who had fled Bree with them after they had lost the fight against the inhabitants of Bree. In the resulting [[Set-to in Bree|set-to]] three Men and two Hobbits from Bree were killed. The defeated ruffians fled to the woods beyond Archet and the wilds where they lived as robbers so that travelling on the road was no longer safe. As a result the inhabitants of Breeland locked up their dwellings early, kept watchers all around the hedge and guarded the gates with a lot of men during the night. He also informed them that the Bree-landers had not understood how much the Rangers of the North had done for their safety, because after they all left (to fight in the War of the Ring in the south) wolves had howled around the fences in the winter and there were dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that make the blood run cold when he thought of them.<ref name=\"Homeward\">{{RK|Homeward}}, p. 992</ref> After staying in Bree for two nights, Frodo and his companions left Bree on [[30 October]], {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for the year 3019, October 30, p. 1096</ref>\n\nAfter the War of the Ring at the end of the [[Third Age]], the North-kingdom of Arnor was reestablished by [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1042</ref> It is probable that Bree became a part of Arnor again and became more prosperous through increased traffic on the Greenway and the East Road, because Gandalf announced that the king would soon be turning his mind to Bree, the Greenway would be opened again, there would be traffic, there would be people and fields where there was wilderness before and that there would be room enough for people between the [[Isen]] and the [[Greyflood]] and along the shorelands south of the Baranduin and that many folk used to live at the northern end of the Greenway on the [[North Downs]] or by [[Lake Evendim]].<ref name=\"Homeward\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Bree'' is an English place name that is based on a [[Celtic]] word for \"hill\".<ref name=\"N\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Archet''', p. 765</ref>\n\n[[Wayne Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] suggest that the name ''Bree'' is derived from the [[Welsh]] word ''bre'', which means \"hill\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 16</ref> [[Tom Shippey]] also points out that ''Bree'' means \"hill\" in Welsh.<ref name=\"Road\">[[Tom Shippey]], [[The Road to Middle-earth]], Chapter 4: A Cartographic Plot, Getting started, third edition, p. 124</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] chose the name ''Bree'' to represent the survival of a trace of the former language of the Men of Bree and modelled it on a British (i.e. Celtic) word, which meant \"hill\".<ref>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref> He referred to [[wikipedia:Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]] in his [[Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]] when he explained that the name [[Chetwood]] was a [[Wikipedia:List of tautological place names|tautological]] compound of a Celtic word for \"wood\" and the english word \"wood\" and stated that the name ''Brill'' was derived from the Celtic word ''bree'' and the English word \"hill\".<ref name=\"N\" /> \n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] confirmed that the name ''Bree'' is based on ''Brill'' in [[wikipedia:Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]], which his father knew well.<ref>{{RS|1VIIN}}, note 6, p. 131</ref> Tom Shippey also suggests that J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired by the town of ''Brill'', which is located on a hill ten miles from [[Oxford]], when he chose the names ''Bree'' and Bree-hill.<ref name=\"Road\" />\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nJ.R.R. Tolkien drew a plan of Bree during the writing of [[The Lord of the Rings]], which corresponds to the description of Bree in the final published version.<ref>{{RS|3XXP}}, p. 333</ref>\n\nAn earlier manuscript about of the Heirs of Elendil, which later became the Annals of the Kings and Rulers and an earlier manuscript version of The Tale of Years mention that Bree was in Cardolan.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Commentary, manuscript B, The Heirs of Elendil, The Northern Line of Arnor: the Isildurioni, entry for Eärendur</ref><ref>{{PM|Third}}, manuscript T4, The Third Age, entry for the year 861</ref> It is possible that the statement that Bree was in Cardolan was deliberately not retained in the published text, because a statement was added in a later manuscript about the Heirs of Elendil that Cardolan was south of the Great Road before the existing statement that Cardolan was east of the Baranduin.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, manuscript C, The Heirs of Elendil, The Northern Line of Arnor: the Isildurioni, entry 10. Eärendur</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Bree map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Bree in [[The Lord of the Rings Online]].]]\n\nWith the absence of [[Tom Bombadil]] and the [[Barrow-downs]] in most adaptations, the distance between Bree and the Shire seems shorter than it really was.\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:After leaving the [[Old Forest]], the Hobbits appear in the Prancing Pony without delay or introduction. The rooms were raided by [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] rather than servants of them.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Here too, Bombadil and the Barrow-downs were omitted. After taking a short walk through Bree, the hobbits enter the Pony. Merry goes out for a walk, and is found by [[Bob]] the ostler. Once again, it is the Ringwraiths rather than servants of them who raid the Pony.\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'''''\n:Frodo and his companions arrive at Bree almost immediately after the scene in which they leave the Shire. All are present in Strider's room when the  Ringwraiths crash the gate, trample the gatekeeper, and raid the Prancing Pony.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:The role of Bree is greatly expanded, due to the interactiveness of the medium. It is the place where the Hobbits meet Strider, and the player shifts perspective. Strider searches the streets of Bree for Merry and materials to make decoys for (once again) the Ringwraiths to slash, while the streets are crowded with robbers and wolves.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Bree is one of the major cities in the north, located in Bree-land, probaly the most important city in the game. It faces threats from several fronts: [[Sharkey]]'s brigands have already began making their way into [[Bree-land]], the [[Barrow-downs]] are stirring following the passage of the [[Nazgûl]] and a small band of [[Orcs]] has made their way from the [[North Downs]]. The citizens of Bree know more of the bigger world than [[The Shire|Shire]] dwellers, but are still oblivious to the dangers they could face. The town's mayor and the watchers don't trust the [[Rangers of the North]], insisting they can manage their own affairs. Later, during the winter of {{TA|3019}}, Bree is overrun by Sharkey's Brigands and [[Half-orcs]] and has to be liberated by Free Peoples - an event references as \"Thievery and Mischief\" by [[Barliman Butterbur]] later.\n\n[[File:Bree-WITN1.png|thumb|250px|Bree in [[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]].]]\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] visit Bree in the beginning of the game, just a few days before [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] reached the town. They meet with [[Aragorn]] in the [[Prancing Pony]].<ref name=\"Prologue\">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>\n:Bree is protected by a dike and hedge and can be entered through two of its gates.<ref>[http://www.warinthenorth.com/ The Lord of the Rings: War in the North's Official Site], [http://www.warinthenorth.com/index.php/the-game/locations Locations], Bree (accessed at [[14 September]], [[2011]])</ref> The most important structures in Bree are the Prancing Pony, [[Elmund Brushwood]]'s smithy and [[Adalgar Oldbank]]'s shop. Several characters appear in Bree: [[Otto Aster]], [[Harley Bramble]], Elmund Brushwood, [[Barliman Butterbur]], [[Grof]], [[Tedder Hedgerow]], Adalgar Oldbank and a [[Southerners|Southerner]], as well as several unnamed [[Bree-landers]].<ref name=\"Prologue\" />\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n:The opening scene takes place in Bree - once again featuring a cameo from [[Peter Jackson]] eating a carrot (see [[Albert Dreary]]) - where [[Gandalf]] and [[Thorin]] meet in the Prancing Pony. Gandalf tells Thorin of his meeting with [[Thráin]], his worries about [[Smaug|the dragon]], and his wish to see Thorin retake the [[Lonely Mountain]]. Gandalf convinces Thorin that they need [[Bilbo Baggins|a burglar]] to retrieve the [[Arkenstone]] in order to summons the \"Seven Armies\" of the [[Dwarves]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Arnor]]\n[[Category:Celtic names]]\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n\n[[de:Bree]]\n[[fi:Brii]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:eriador:bree]]\n[[Category:Bree-land]]",

The colour of the rock was a deep, gleaming black. At Orthanc's pinnacle the four piers opened out to form four pinnacles of sharp rock; between these isles of rock there was a narrow, polished floor on which many strange signs were written.<ref name=\"TTRoad\">{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|There stood a tower of marvellous shape.

Thus, Orthanc became one of the seven [[Dúnedain]] towers which stored the seeing stones that had been brought from [[Númenor]].<ref name=\"SV\">{{S|V}}</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\nThe region of [[Calenardhon]] was never densely populated; indeed it suffered greatly in the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}} and many inhabitants of Númenórean descent gradually migrated eastward. Eventually the tower of Orthanc itself became deserted, and [[Key of Orthanc|its keys]] were removed to [[Minas Tirith]] and held in the keeping of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]].<ref name=\"UTPalantiri\">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2510}},<ref name=\"UTIsen\">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> after the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], the lands of [[Calenardhon]] were ceded to the [[Éothéod]] and [[Eorl]] became the first king of [[Rohan]]. Nonetheless Gondor retained control of the fortress of Isengard, and Orthanc remained the third tower of the southern realm. During this time Isengard was manned by a small number of Gondorians led by a hereditary Captain. However the keys of Orthanc were kept by the Stewards of Gondor.<ref name=\"UTCirion\">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>\n\nOver time the links and correspondence between Isengard and [[Minas Tirith]] became ever more infrequent; whilst retaining the keys of Orthanc, the Stewards forsook the tower as their thoughts looked eastwards. Eventually the line of Gondorian chieftains failed and the people mingled ever more with the [[Dunlendings]]. They even allowed them entry into Isengard and eventually the two peoples willingly merged into one. Thus it was that Isengard came under the control of the Dunlendings who led numerous raids on the [[Westfold]]. Whilst the Rohirrim had not the strength to assail the fortress, the Dunlendings were eventually starved out in the great famine after the [[Long Winter]]. Therefore both [[Fréaláf|King Fréaláf]] and [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Beren]] greatly welcomed [[Saruman|Saruman's]] offer to take command of Isengard. Thus it was that, in {{TA|2759}},<ref name=\"AppStewards\">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> the wizard was given the keys of Orthanc.<ref name=\"UTIsen\" />\n\nSaruman began to desire [[the One Ring]] for himself and hoped that it might reveal itself by giving [[Sauron]] time to re-gain his strength. As head of the [[White Council]], Saruman overruled Gandalf's call for an attack on [[Dol Guldur]] in {{TA|2851}}. However, in {{TA|2941}}, after Saruman discovered that the servants of Sauron were searching for the Ring near [[Gladden Fields]], he agreed to attack Sauron's fortress in [[Mirkwood]]. After the last meeting of the White Council in {{TA|2953}}, Saruman withdrew to [[Isengard]] and fortified it. It was in ''circa'' {{TA|3000}} that Saruman used the [[Orthanc-stone]] for the first time. Thus it was that Sauron corrupted Saruman's mind and bent it to his will.<ref name=\"AppB2\">{{App|B2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Howe - Gwaihir rescues Gandalf from Orthanc.jpg|thumb|right|''Gwaihir rescues Gandalf from Orthanc'' by [[John Howe]]]]\n{{Blockquote|Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web!|[[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[The Council of Elrond]]\"}}\n\nIn {{TA|3018}}, [[Gandalf]] rode to the foot of Orthanc and there met [[Saruman]]. It was then that Saruman revealed his true thoughts to Gandalf. He declared his desire to become a ruler of [[Men]] and to join with [[Sauron]]. But, most importantly, he announced his desire for the One Ring. Gandalf refused to submit to Sauron and Saruman. Subsequently, Saruman had Gandalf taken to the pinnacle of Orthanc where, Saruman schemed, Gandalf would stay until he revealed the location of the One Ring or until Sauron reclaimed it for himself. There Gandalf was trapped and for the first time he saw [[wolves]] and [[orcs]] in the valley of Isengard below. After many weeks of imprisonment,<ref group=\"note\">[[Gandalf]] was imprisoned on [[10 July]], {{TA|3018}} and escaped in the early hours of [[18 September]], {{TA|3018|n}}.</ref> Gandalf escaped as [[Gwaihir]] the Great [[Eagle]] came unlooked-for to Orthanc and bore him away.<ref name=\"FRCouncil\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nOn [[2 March]], {{TA|3019}}, the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] began their [[Battle of Isengard|attack on Isengard]].

Therein Saruman remained.<ref name=\"TTFlotsam\">{{TT|Flotsam}}</ref> On [[5 March]], [[Théoden]], [[Éomer]], [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]] approached the foot of Orthanc and climbed its stair until they reached the door. There they parleyed with Saruman, who remained inside the tower and spoke to them from a balcony above the door. Saruman refused to co-operate and subsequently Gandalf cast him from the [[Istari|order of Wizards]] and the [[White Council]], and broke Saruman's staff. After this confrontation, [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]], who was also inside Orthanc, threw the [[Orthanc-stone|''palantír'' of Orthanc]] at the party outside as a parting shot.<ref name=\"TTVoice\">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>\n\nA week before [[22 August]], {{TA|3019}},<ref name=\"AppB3\"/> when [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and company arrived at Orthanc, Saruman had departed Isengard with Gríma Wormtongue. However, before he left, [[Treebeard]] made him lock the tower and hand over the keys of Orthanc.<ref name=\"RKPartings\">{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\n===Fourth Age===\nOne of [[Aragorn|King Elessar's]] first tasks in the re-ordering of his realm was the restoration of Orthanc. He ordered that the ''[[palantír]]'' recovered from [[Saruman]] should be returned to the tower. It was then that the tower was searched and many secrets were revealed. It became clear that Saruman had hoarded many ancient treasures and heirlooms. They found that, with the aid of [[Gríma|Wormtongue]], Saruman had acquired jewels and heirlooms of [[Eorl]]. With the help of [[Gimli]] a hidden door was found and opened. Inside a casket found on a shelf they found two precious items. One was a small golden case attached to a chain; this was used by [[Isildur]] to bear [[the One Ring]]. The second item in the casket was the [[Elendilmir]], the \"white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of ''[[mithril]]''\" that had been lost since Isildur's demise. Elessar received the Elendilmir with reverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of [[Arnor]]. It was clear that Saruman had found the remains of Isildur and that he had probably burned the body.<ref name=\"UTIsen\" />\n\nOrthanc and the lands of Isengard remained part of the [[Reunited Kingdom|Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor]]. However King Elessar granted the [[Ents]] complete self-governance of the area surrounding Orthanc. This new forest became known as the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]].<ref name=\"RKPartings\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Orthanc'' displays a curious double etymology (co-existing \"by design or chance\") since it has a meaning both in the \"[[Rohanese|language of the Mark of old]]\" (rendered as [[Old English]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') and [[J.R.R.

During a [[The One Ring|ring]]-induced dream, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] dreams of taking the Ring and storming the Tower, but his common sense gains the upper hand in time.<ref>[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]], \"Samwise the Strong\"</ref>\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Barad-dûr is one of the first sites visited.

Using the size scale for the model implemented for the films, the Dark Tower is  depicted as being over 1500 meters (5,000 feet) tall.\n:''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' also shows Barad-dûr as clearly visible from the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor. Even granting its enormous size, it was located one hundred miles away and to the east of the Gate, and behind the inner mountain ridges of [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]] so [[Aragorn]]'s army would probably not have been able to see it. In the film version, the geography of Mordor seems generally to have been compressed somewhat, perhaps for artistic reasons related to rendering such complex stories in a visual medium. In the case of the Black Gate scene, having Barad-dûr visible from the Gate means that the army can see the Eye of Sauron staring at them.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:The Tower is briefly visible in the opening scene. [[Galadriel]] narrates a vision from her [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]]. It is only referred to as \"The Dark Tower of Mordor\", and it is the base of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] (as opposed to [[Minas Morgul]]). The Eye of Sauron is portrayed as a fiery eye at the top, but is only visible for a split second.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:Barad-dûr is shown in the introduction scene. It's design is similar to that of the tower in the movies. It does not play a role in any of the campaigns, and does not appear on any of the maps.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Like in its predecessor, the tower of Barad-dûr plays no active role in this game. In the \"War of the Ring\" mode, it can be seen in the territory of Mordor, but is absent on the map itself.\n\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:With the destruction of the One Ring, the main tower of Barad-dûr had collapsed, but the foundations remain standing and teeming with Sauron's servants. The dungeons of Barad-dûr, the \"Mordath\", have been exposed to the sky above through the cracks in the earth.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Siege of Barad-dûr]]\n*[[Mordor]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barad-dur}}\n[[Category:Fortresses]]\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Towers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Barad-dûr]]\n[[fi:Barad-dûr]]\n[[fi:Musta Torni]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:mordor:barad-dur]]",

In its days of glory, the city featured quays to handle sea-going vessels that came up from the sea, a great stone bridge supporting houses and towers of stone, and the [[Dome of Stars]], which housed the [[Master Stone of Osgiliath]], the greatest of the seven ''[[Palantíri]]''.<ref name=\"rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFounded by [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]]<ref name=\"rings\" /> near the end of the [[Second Age]], Osgiliath was designated the capital of the southern Númenórean kingdom in exile, [[Gondor]]. \n\nSoon after its founding, Sauron attacked and [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|took]] [[Minas Ithil]] in {{SA|3429}} and then moved westward.

It was during this siege that the Master Stone of Osgiliath was lost in the River. The [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636|n}} led to further depopulation with many victims, and some fled to the western dales or [[Ithilien]]; few returned and the city began to fall into ruin; the [[King's House]] was moved to the more secure [[Minas Anor]] in {{TA|1640|n}}.<ref name=\"ta\">{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few hundred years, Gondor endured many military defeats east of the [[Anduin]], especially the [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|taking]] of [[Minas Ithil]] in {{TA|2002|n}}. Osgiliath became vulnerable to attack and was widely believed to be haunted, as its population continued to shrink. Osgiliath was finally abandoned by the remaining civilian population after being [[Ruin of Osgiliath|overrun]] by [[Uruk-hai]] in {{TA|2475|n}}, although the orcs were defeated by Steward [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]].<ref name=\"ta\" />\n\nOver the following centuries, the western part of the ruined city was under the control of Gondor, and was at times provided with a military garrison as a means of defending the crossing of the Anduin. The eastern part, with [[Ithilien]], was disputed territory, under Gondor's control for most of the rule of [[Denethor|Denethor II]], but in June of {{TA|3018|n}} it was [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|taken and occupied]] by [[Sauron]]'s forces and its last bridge fell. This attack some later considered to be the beginning of the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=\"great\">{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nIn the following March, well into the War, Sauron launched a full-scale invasion of Gondor west of the Anduin, and despite the [[Rangers of Ithilien|Rangers']] [[Faramir's defence of Osgiliath|defence of the western part of the city]], Osgiliath quickly fell to Sauron's forces,<ref name=\"great\" /> but it was reclaimed by Gondor after Sauron's ultimate defeat a few weeks later.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Osgiliath'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Citadel of the Stars\"<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 244</ref> or \"Fortress of the Stars\",<ref name=\"RGEO\">{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 65</ref><ref>{{L|347}}, p. 426</ref> being a combination of ''[[ost]]'' (\"citadel\", \"fortress\") + ''[[giliath]]'' (\"hosts of stars\").<ref name=\"UI\" />\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Osgiliath in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:War in Middle Earth - Osgiliath.png|Osgiliath in ''[[J.R.R.

The maps shows the bridge but the city itself is not shown.\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:After capturing [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Faramir]] takes them to Osgiliath, in the hope of harnessing the power of [[One Ring|the Ring]] to the betterment of Gondor. Osgiliath is fully ruined, and partly flooded. After being attacked by several [[fell beasts|winged Nazgûl]], Faramir releases them.\n\n:In a scene in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], Faramir has a flashback. [[Boromir]] reclaims the city for Gondor, and the soldiers feast. The scene is meant to highlight the relation between Boromir, Faramir and [[Denethor]].\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:[[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] and his [[orcs]] finally breach the defences of the Gondorian troopers, and beat them back with heavy losses. [[Madril]] is slain, as are several others. On their retreat to [[Minas Tirith]], they are beset by the [[Nazgûl]], only to be saved by [[Gandalf]].\n\n:Not impressed by Faramir's deeds, and more upset about the loss of Osgiliath, Denethor sends his son back to Osgiliath, but his company is slaughtered, and Faramir badly wounded. This scene replaced the defence of the [[Causeway Forts]] in the book.\n\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''\n:Osgiliath is featured in the game with it's appeareance being based on Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|films]].

After the Battle the situation is reversed: the city has been reclaimed as the Host of the West makes its way to the Black Gate, but remaining enemies still hold out in the culverts below. A third version of the city, set in T.A. 3018 during the [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath]] is the battleground for player-versus-monster-player fights; this version is notable for having all bridges across the Anduin still intact.\n\n:The notable landmarks are the Gates of the Moon at the eastern entrance to the city are beyond which is the Court of [[Isildur]], the Gates of the Sun at the western entrance beyond which is the Court of [[Anárion]], The Palace of [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] in the north-west corner of the city, [[Meneldil]]'s Square, Rómendacil's Square, the Theatre of [[Cemendur (King of Gondor)|Cemendur]] and the [[Dome of Stars]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Osgiliath]]\n[[fi:Osgiliath]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/gondor/osgiliath]]",

The land ran down toward the river in slopes and terraces. The City of Minas Tirith was located on the south-western corner of the fields, at the foot of [[Mindolluin|Mount Mindolluin]].\n\nA road ran north-east across the Pelennor Fields to the [[Causeway Forts]] on the river bank; a distance of 12 miles. The [[Great West Road|North-way]] led from the City through the fields to the [[Forannest]], or north-gate, before turning westward to become the [[Great West Road]] to [[Rohan]]. The [[South Road]] came from the southern provinces of Gondor and passed through the Pelennor Fields on the way to Minas Tirith. A number of other paths also crisscrossed the fields.\n\nThe Pelennor Fields were home to farmers and herdsmen who had barns, pens, livestock, granaries, and kilns for drying hops and malt which were located on the Pelennor. The fields were fertile farmland, with tilled fields, orchards, and small brooks flowing down to the Anduin.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter [[Minas Ithil]] had [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|fallen]] and been renamed [[Minas Morgul]], the Fields were walled by the great wall of [[Rammas Echor]] by [[Ecthelion II]] in {{TA|2954}}, to prevent an invasion.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 546</ref> Presumably, the Fields took their name because of this enclosure.<ref>Cf. [[#Etymology|the Etymology section]] concerning the meaning of the name.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], the people and livestock evacuated the lands, seeing the coming invasion of the forces of [[Sauron]] from [[Minas Morgul]]. Indeed, [[Orcs]] and evil [[Men]] overran the Rammas Echor on [[13 March]] and on [[14 March|the next day]] [[Siege of Gondor|besieged the city]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref><ref name=Fields/> Homes and trees were burned and trenches were carved through the fields and filled with fire. The Pelennor Fields were the location of the ensuing [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], when [[Théoden]], [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]] and the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] and his [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]] were slain.<ref name=Fields>{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n\n===After the Battle===\nAfter the battle, the grass began to grow back on the fields. [[Snowmane's Howe]], where [[Théoden]]'s [[Snowmane|horse]] was buried, grew especially green. The location at which the Witch-king and his steed had been killed was stained black and no grass grew from the scorched earth.<ref name=Fields/>\n\nOn [[1 May]] {{TA|3019|n}} the coronation of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] took place, and those of Gondor and [[Rohan]] gathered on the Pelennor Fields to witness the event.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Pelennor'' translates to \"fenced, encircled land\" in [[Sindarin]].<ref name=\"lotrindex\">{{RK|Index}}</ref><ref name=RC>{{HM|UI}}, p. 512</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 95</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that the first element derives from the [[Elvish]] root/element ''[[PEL|pel-]]'' (\"go round, encircle\");<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> the other elements appear to be ''end'' (from ''enedh'' \"middle\")' + ''[[dôr|(n-)dor]]'' (\"land, dwelling\").<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names#p Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com/ Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 27 June 2011)</ref> The field was called by several other names as well, such as ''Fields of Pelennor'', ''the Pelennor'', and ''the townlands''.<ref name=RC/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Fields, plains and deserts]]\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]",

Tolkien]] wrote in a [[Letter 211|letter]] that the [[Númenóreans]] of Gondor resembled Egyptians in many ways, including their love of, and ability to construct, the gigantic and massive, and in their interest in ancestry and tombs.<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 281</ref> [[Wayne G.

Near the river ivy clung to grey stone chimneys and further ridges were topped with firs twisted by wind.<ref name=\"River\"/>  On three sides Emyn Muil ended in cliffs:  In the west the uplands ended abruptly in the [[East Wall of Rohan]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> In the south the [[Anduin]] cascaded over [[Rauros]], a great waterfall.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>  In the east, although of lower elevation, the barren hills still ended in a steep edge.<ref name=\"Taming\"/>\n\nThe [[Anduin]] cut through the hills on its southward course. In the north the river narrowed and passed through [[Sarn Gebir]]. No boats could survive these rapids and travelers had to use a portage way on the west bank. South of Sarn Gebir the river plunged between towering cliffs until it passed between the two great statues of the [[Argonath]].  A little further and the pent waters opened into a long oval lake called [[Nen Hithoel]]. On the southern end of the lake were three peaks: [[Amon Lhaw]] on the east bank, [[Tol Brandir]] amid two arms of the river, and [[Amon Hen]] on the western side. At the foot of Amon Hen was a green clearing, [[Parth Galen]], and south of it was the [[North Stair]] that allowed for passage to the bottom of Rauros and Emyn Muil.<ref name=\"River\"/>\n\n== History ==\nAfter Prince [[Rómendacil II|Minalcar]] of [[Gondor]] had defeated a large army of [[Easterlings]] in {{TA|1248}} (and took the name  Rómendacil) he fortified the west bank of the Anduin and built the pillars of the Argonath in the Emyn Muil.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2510|n}}, the Steward [[Cirion]] bequeathed the land of [[Calenardhon]] to [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]].  After pledging the [[Oath of Eorl]] the bounds of the new realm of [[Rohan]] were determined; in the east these were the Anduin and the [[East Wall of Rohan|west-cliff]] of the Emyn Muil.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, ''(iii) Cirion and Eorl''</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|3002|n}} [[Orc]] raiders battled with some [[Rohirrim]], and [[Éomund]] was slain there.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\n[[Aragorn]] captured [[Gollum]] on [[1 February]],<ref name=\"Hunt\">{{UT|Hunt}},  ''(ii) Other Versions of the Story''</ref> {{TA|3017|n}} in the [[Dead Marshes]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  To avoid detection by the spies of [[Sauron]], Aragorn drove his captive through the northern Emyn Muil before crossing the Anduin.<ref name=\"Hunt\"/>\n\nIn {{TA|3019}} the Fellowship of the Ring encountered the Emyn Muil.
